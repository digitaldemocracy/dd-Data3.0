          SENATE VOTE:  36-0


          SUBJECT:  Arthritis Awareness Month.


          SUMMARY:  Proclaims the month of May 2015 as Arthritis Awareness  
          Month.  Specifically, this resolution makes the following  
          legislative findings:


          1)Arthritis is a chronic health problem that is the nation's  
            leading cause of physical disability among Americans and is  
            most common among people with multiple chronic conditions.  It  
            includes more than 100 rheumatic diseases and conditions that  
            affect joints, tissues that surround joints, and other  
            connective tissue.

          2)Arthritis affects an estimated 52.5 million American adults  
            living with some form of doctor-diagnosed arthritis,  
            representing 22.7% of adults in the United States.  An  
            estimated 300,000 children under 18 years of age have a form  
            of arthritis or rheumatic condition, representing  
            approximately 1 in every 250 children in the United States.   
            By the year 2030, an estimated 67 million adults 18 years of  
            age and older will have doctor-diagnosed arthritis.

          3)In California, there are more than 5.9 million people living  
            with arthritis, including 38,000 children.  Among working age  
            adults with arthritis in California, 43% have some work  
            limitations due to their arthritis.

          4)Arthritis costs the United States economy more than $128  
            billion each year -$81 billion in direct medical care costs  
            and $47 billion in indirect costs.
