          Date of Hearing:  April 7, 2015


           ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, TOURISM, AND  
                                   INTERNET MEDIA


                             Ian Charles Calderon, Chair


          ACR 46  
          (Calderon) - As Introduced March 17, 2015


          SUBJECT:  Arts Council:  funding.


          SUMMARY:  Would declare the importance of the arts to the state  
          and the essential role of the Arts Council in promoting the arts  
          throughout the state, and urge a unified effort between the  
          Legislature and the Governor to provide a substantial increase  
          in the General Fund appropriation to the California Arts Council  
          (CAC). Specifically, this Resolution makes the following  
          findings:  


          1)Since the 1970s, the Arts Council, also known as the  
            California Arts Council, has served the state by strategically  
            promoting increased access to the arts for all Californians,  
            particularly for residents living in communities that lack  
            sufficient and convenient opportunities to experience the  
            benefits of the arts in their lives.



          2)In the past, the state appropriated funds that could  
            meaningfully support the programs of the Arts Council.  
            However, beginning in 2003, the annual funding of the Arts  
            Council from the General Fund drastically dropped, and since  








                                                                     ACR 46


                                                                    Page  2





            that time, the funding has remained essentially flat at a  
            $1,000,000 annual appropriation, making California one of the  
            lowest ranked states to invest in the arts on a per capita  
            basis. The programs of the Arts Council that once reached  
            rural towns, underserved urban neighborhoods, prisons, and  
            schools have either been depleted or discontinued entirely.



          3)The arts invigorate the state and national economies. The  
            creative sector has become one of the state's most important  
            drivers of economic growth. The 2013 OTIS Report on the  
            Creative Economy, analyzing the economic impact of the  
            creative economy in the state, concluded that 9.7 percent of  
            jobs in the state are connected, directly or indirectly, to  
            the creative industries. A recent report by the U.S. Bureau of  
            Economic Analysis concluded that the arts and culture sector  
            represent 3.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product  
            in 2011.



          4)The arts bolster small and large businesses and the nonprofit  
            sector. Local merchants directly benefit when people attend  
            art events in their community because attendees make purchases  
            related to the event, including, among other things, meals and  
            parking. Nationally, in 2011, exports outside the United  
            States of art-related goods, including, but not limited to,  
            movies, paintings, and jewelry, substantially increased and  
            resulted in a trade surplus within the arts industry. The  
            national nonprofit arts industry annually generates billions  
            in economic activity and provides millions of jobs.



          5)The arts increase tourism and travel. Arts travelers are ideal  
            tourists, staying longer and spending more to seek out  
            authentic cultural experiences than other types of travelers.  
            Reports show that the percentage of international travelers  








                                                                     ACR 46


                                                                    Page  3





            visiting museums and attending concerts and theater  
            performances have steadily grown since 2003.



          6)The arts spark creativity and innovation in the workforce.  
            Creativity is recognized as one of the top five applied  
            employee skills sought by business leaders. Nobel laureates in  
            the sciences are 17 times more likely to be actively engaged  
            in the arts than other scientists.





          7)The arts enhance our society. A recent study demonstrated that  
            a high concentration of the arts in a city leads to higher  
            civic engagement, more social cohesion, higher child welfare,  
            and lower poverty rates. A vibrant arts community ensures that  
            young people are not left to experience their society through  
            a pop culture and tabloid marketplace.



          8)The arts improve healthcare. Nearly one-half of the nation's  
            healthcare institutions provide arts programming for patients,  
            families, and staff on the basis that art programs promote  
            healing in patients, resulting in shorter hospital stays,  
            better pain management, and less medication.



          9)The arts are fundamental to our human experience. The arts  
            inspire us to see our human potential by fostering creativity,  
            goodness, and beauty. The arts help us express our values,  
            build bridges between cultures, and bring people together,  
            regardless of perceived differences in ethnicity, religion, or  
            age. As a well-known idiom reminds us, "[w]hen times are  
            tough, art is salve for the ache."

                                                                    Page  4








          10)The arts improve academic performance. Students with an  
            education rich in the arts have higher grades and standardized  
            test scores and lower rates of dropping out of school.  
            Students with four years of arts or music in high school  
            average 100 more points on their SAT scores than students with  
            just one-half of a year of arts or music. While art education  
            is mandated by state law, California is failing to provide a  
            sufficient arts education. For the past 30 years arts  
            education in schools has been disappearing at an alarming  
            rate. Between 1999 and 2004, student enrollment in music  
            education declined by almost half. The state's recent fiscal  
            crisis has resulted in still more dramatic cuts to visual and  
            performing arts education programs for students throughout the  
            state.



          11)The Governor's currently proposed funding for the Arts  
            Council in the 2015-16 Budget Act is a total of $5,000,000, a  
            combination of $1,000,000 from the General Fund, $1,000,000  
            matching federal funds, and the remainder consisting of  
            revenues from a specialty license plate supporting the arts.



          12)By increasing the state's investment in the arts through  
            funding the programs of the Arts Council in the 2015-16 Budget  
            Act, the Legislature and the Governor would strengthen the  
            ability of the Arts Council to invigorate the state and  
            national economies, including businesses of all sizes and the  
            nonprofit sector, foster creativity in the lives of people in  
            their workplace and communities, secure a more solid cultural  
            and educational experience for our children, and cultivate  
            healthy human lives, both physically and emotionally.

          COMMENTS:  


          1)Author's statement and support.


            According to the lead author Assemblymember Calderon, "ACR 46  
            encourages continuing the forward trend of increased funding  
            for the arts as an investment in a proven and powerful  
            catalyst for spurring local economies and for preparing  
            California's workforce to prosper in the global creative  
            economy." He adds, "California's cultural enterprises provide  
            more than 1.4 million jobs for Californians or 7.8% of total  
            employment; in addition California's non-profit arts  
            specifically contribute more than $13 billion to the state's  
            economy. The arts are a key partner to the creative  
            industries, encourage creativity, help prepare students and  
            workers to compete in the 21st Century global economy, attract  
            creative workers and industries of all kinds, stimulate the  
            economy, engage residents, provide a sense of community,  
            celebrating diversity and building bridges, understanding, and  
            draw tourists and visitors.





            "Despite their strong contribution to the state, with the  
            single exception of 2014, California has ranked last among all  








                                                                     ACR 46


                                                                    Page  6





            the states in per capita investment in the arts - allocating  
            just $1 million from the general fund annually - since 2003.  
            This adds up to a mere three cents per person annually. Last  
            year was a bright spot and we hoped the beginning of moving  
            back toward our rightful place as the leader among states in  
            support for the arts, when the Assembly approved $10 million  
            dollars in our budget proposal, and the Governor signed the  
            Conference Committee compromise amount of $6 million into the  
            budget.  This forward progress must be maintained; the  
            Governor's proposal to revert back to $1 million for the CAC  
            is simply not acceptable."





            Assemblymember Nazarian, Joint Author and strong supporter of  
            CAC, adds, "I am confident that if arts advocates in and out  
            of the Legislature keep pressing for higher funding during  
            this year's budget proceedings, the result ultimately should  
            be a spending plan that builds on the 2014 increase." He  
            concludes by saying, "This is something we need to speak up on  
            until it gets to the point that governors automatically  
            include the previous year's arts appropriation as a starting  
            point for the next round of budgeting."





            Arts Orange County writes the committee to say, "Arts Orange  
            County wishes to express its strong support a significant  
            increase in general fund appropriations for the California  
            Arts Council. Orange County-and indeed much of our  
            state-depends upon creativity range from The Boeing Company to  
            Disneyland, from Blizzard Entertainment to Hurley, from Red  
            Digital Cameras to medical device companies like Allergan.  
            Having a healthy ecology provides the right kind of  
            environment for these companies to thrive and to contribute to

            California's contributing role as the world's incubator of  
            great ideas."


          2)Background: funding for the arts.


            The CAC was created in 1975 under then Governor Jerry Brown to  
            increase access to the arts for all Californians. The CAC  
            budget had grown from its first full year of funding in fiscal  
            year 1976-77 at $1,917,000 to $32,224,000 in fiscal year  
            2001-02, when 1,590 grants were awarded to non-profit arts  
            organizations. In 2003, appropriations to the CAC were cut by  
            97%, and GF appropriation from the Legislature has remained  
            essentially flat at $1,000,000 over the past decade. Since  
            2003, with the exception of last year, California has ranked  
            last or next to last among the states in terms of per capita  
            investment in the arts. However, the last two budget cycles  
            have seen an uptick in spending: 

               Funding levels for CAC in the fiscal year 2012-13 were just  
               over $5,000,000 broken down by source as follows:


              General Fund                       $1,019,865

                                                                    Page  8





              Total                              $5,309,540  


                
               Funding levels for CAC in the fiscal year 2013-14 were  
               almost $8,000,000 broken down by source as follows:


              General Fund                       $1,082,000


              Graphic Design License Plate Account $2,815,000


              National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)  $1,035,000


              Reimbursements ($2 million from Assembly)  $3,026,000  


              Total                              $7,958,000  



                Current funding levels for CAC in the fiscal year 2014-15  
               were just over $10,000,000 broken down by source as  
               follows:


              General Fund                       $6,137,000

          3)Spending the additional money.



            Recent funding discussions for the CAC have ranged in amounts  
            from the current base of $1million general fund contained in  
            the Governor's proposed budget, to $75million contained in AB  
            580 (Nazarian), Legis. of 2014, discussed below. One of the  
            major concerns is whether the agency would have sufficient  
            staff and programmatic capacity to effectively spend any  
            substantial new influx of funding. When this question was  
            posed to the CAC by committee staff they responded in the  
            affirmative, and offered as proof their use of the addition $5  
            million dollars allocated last year:





            According to the CAC, "On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed a  
            state budget that includes a one-time $5 million increase in  
            General Fund support for the California Arts Council. This is  
            the first time in over ten years the arts have seen an  
            increase of General Fund monies, after the support for the  
            Council was cut by 94 percent in 2003. The $5 million

                                                                    Page  10





            investment from last year's budget will build on programs from  
            2013-14 and add new ones. The following is a list of the  
            programs that will be funded with the investment from last  
            year: 





             a)   Creative California Communities, transforming  
               communities through the arts and economic development  
               ($1,467,000);



             b)   Local Impact, revitalizing California's underserved and  
               rural communities through the arts ($1,345,000);



             c)   State-Local Partnership, fostering arts and cultural  
               development through local leadership ($400,000);



             d)   Statewide Networks, supporting multicultural, and  
               discipline-based arts networks ($375,000);



             e)   Poetry Out Loud, helping students master public speaking  
               skills and build self-confidence ($50,000);

             f)   JUMPstArts, supporting arts education programs for youth

          4)Prior and Related Legislation. 



             a)   AB 1662 (Calderon), of 2013-14 would have created an  
               annual continuous appropriation from the General Fund (GF)  
               to the California Arts Council (CAC) in an unspecified  
               amount, and made various legislative findings and  
               declarations. AB 1662 was heard and passed out of this  
               committee but was held in the Assembly Committee on  
               Appropriations on Suspense.



             b)   AB 580 (Nazarian), of 2013-14, substantially similar to  
               AB 1662, but contained an appropriation of $75 million  
               dollars for CAC. AB 580 was heard and passed out of this  
               committee but was held in the Assembly Committee on  
               Appropriations on Suspense.



             c)   SB 1432 (Lieu), of 2013-14, also substantially similar  
               to AB 1662, but with a $25 million dollar continuous  
               appropriation for CAC. SB 1432 held in Senate  
               Appropriations.



             d)   SB 571 (Price), Chapter 430, Statues of 2013, allowed  
               taxpayers to once again make voluntary contributions to the  








                                                                     ACR 46


                                                                    Page  13





               California Arts Council Fund on their state personal income  
               tax returns.



             e)   SB 1076 (Price), Chapter 319, Statutes of 2010, allowed  
               taxpayers to make voluntary contributions to the California  
               Arts Council Fund on their state personal income tax  
               returns. This act sunset due to failure of the CAC to reach  
               the statutory threshold of $250,000 in tax donations.



             f)   AB 700 (Krekorian), of 2009-10, would have established  
               the Creative Industries and Community Economic  
               Revitalization Fund in the State Treasury, and required  
               that 20% of all revenues derived from the payment of sales  
               and use taxes that are remitted to the State Board of  
               Equalization by the taxpayers engaged in specified lines of  
               business, as provided, be deposited in the fund. The CAC  
               would be authorized to expend the moneys in the fund, upon  
               appropriation by the Legislature, to issue grants pursuant  
               to the act, as specified. AB 700 was held in the Assembly  
               Committee on Appropriations on Suspense.



             g)   AB 2728 (Karnette), of 2007-08, would have required 20%  
               of state sales and use tax revenues derived from the sales  
               of specified art-related goods be deposited in the State  
               Treasury for allocation to the CAC once the GF achieves  
               structural balance. AB 2728 was held in Assembly  
               Appropriations Committee.



             h)   AB 1365 (Karnette), of 2007-08, was a substantially  
               similar measure to AB 2728, without the balanced budget  
               trigger requirement. AB 1365 was held in Assembly

               Appropriations Committee.



             i)   AB 655 (Leno), of 2005-06, proposed a 1% surcharge on  
               the price of admission to specified arts and entertainment  
               venues. AB 655 was held in this committee.
