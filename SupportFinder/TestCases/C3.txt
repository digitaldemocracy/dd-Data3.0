           SUBJECT  :  Hospitals: seismic safety.

           SUMMARY  :  Permits a hospital in the City of Willits to request an  
          eight-month deadline extension of a seismic safety requirement  
          that hospitals be rebuilt or retrofitted to be capable of  
          withstanding an earthquake, which it is currently required to  
          meet by January 1, 2015, so that this hospital could have until  
          September 1, 2015, to meet this seismic safety requirement.
          
          Existing law:
          1)Establishes timelines for hospital compliance with seismic  
            safety standards, including a requirement that buildings  
            posing a significant risk of collapse and a danger to the  
            public (referred to as SPC -1 buildings) be rebuilt or  
            retrofitted to be capable of withstanding an earthquake, or  
            removed from acute care service, by January 1, 2008, and a  
            requirement that hospital buildings be capable of remaining  
            intact after an earthquake, and must also be capable of  
            continued operation by January 1, 2030.

          2)Permits the Office of Statewide Health Planning and  
            Development (OSHPD) to grant an extension of up to five years  
            to the 2008 deadline, which would be January 1, 2013, for  
            hospitals for which compliance will result in a loss of health  
            care capacity, as defined.  Existing law also allows OSHPD to  
            grant various further extensions beyond this, including up to  
            two years, which would be January 1, 2015, for certain  
            hospitals that face construction delays, hospitals that  
            encounter delays due to an attempt to reclassify their  
            buildings to higher seismic status, and hospitals that  
            experience local planning delays.  

          3)Permits a hospital to continue operating under  a deadline

            extension if either of the following occurs before the end of  
            the extension:

                  a)        A replacement building has been constructed  
                    and a certificate of occupancy has been granted by  
                    OSHPD for the replacement building; or,
                  b)        A retrofit has been performed on the building  
                    and a construction final has been obtained by OSHPD. 

          4)Permits a hospital located in the Counties of Sacramento, San  
            Mateo, or Santa Barbara, or the City of San Jose, that has  
            received the additional two year extension to January 1, 2015  
            described in 2) above, to request an additional extension  
            until September 1, 2015, to obtain either a certificate of  
            occupancy from OSHPD for a replacement building, or a  
            construction final from OSHPD on a retrofitted building.

          This bill:
          1)Adds a hospital located in the City of Willits to existing  
            provisions of law that permit hospitals located in the  
            Counties of Sacramento, San Mateo, or Santa Barbara or the  
            City of San Jose, that have received an additional extension  
            of the January 1, 2008, seismic safety requirement under  
            specified provisions of existing law to January 1, 2015, to  
            request an additional extension until September 1, 2015, in  
            order to obtain either a certificate of occupancy or a  
            construction final from OSHPD.

          2)Contains an urgency clause, stating that to prevent the loss  
            of hospital licensure, Medicaid and Medicare funding, and  
            eligibility for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance  
            following a disaster that would lead to hospital closures and  
            loss of access to health care in the City of Willits, it is  
            necessary for this act to take effect immediately.

          3)Makes legislative findings and declarations that a special law  
            is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable  
            because of the unique circumstances facing hospitals in the  
            City of Willits that are working on meeting seismic safety  
            building standards.

           FISCAL  
          EFFECT  :  According to the Assembly Appropriations Committee,  
          costs to OSHPD to oversee this delay are minor and absorbable.

          COMMENTS  :
          1)Author's statement.  According to the author, the Frank R.  
            Howard Memorial Hospital (HMH) has been in construction and  
            working to meet the seismic safety requirements. However,  
            given the rural nature of the area, the construction project  
            has encountered unforeseen circumstances that delayed  
            completion of the hospital from meeting the deadline. This  
            bill seeks to provide an extension to HMH until September 1,  
            2015, to complete construction on a project that is nearly  
            completed. This is the same extension given to 5 other  
            hospitals last year, provided by the passage of AB 2557 (Pan,  
            Chapter 821, Statutes of 2014). If the deadline is not  
            extended, HMH could lose its license and even jeopardize its  
            ability to participate in Medicare and Medicaid program, which  
            is about 80 percent of their patients this hospital serves.
            
          2)Hospital seismic requirements.  Following the 1971 San  
            Fernando Valley earthquake, California enacted the Alfred E.  
            Alquist Hospital Facility Seismic Safety Act of 1973 (Alquist  
            Act), which mandated that all new hospital construction meet  
            stringent seismic safety standards.  In 1994, after the  
            Northridge earthquake, the Legislature passed and the Governor  
            signed SB 1953 (Alquist, Chapter 740, Statutes of 1994), which  
            required OSHPD to establish earthquake performance categories  
            for hospitals, and established a January 1, 2008, deadline by  
            which general acute care hospitals must be retrofitted or  
            replaced so that they do not pose a risk of collapse in the  
            event of an earthquake, and a January 1, 2030, deadline by  
            which they must be capable of remaining operational following  
            an earthquake.  SB 1953 also allowed most hospitals to qualify  
            for an extension of the January 1, 2008 deadline to January 1,  
            2013.









          AB 81 (Wood)                                        Page 4 of ?
          
          
          Current law allows an extension of the 2008 deadline if  
            compliance will result in an interruption of health care  
            services provided by hospitals within the area.  Hospital  
            owners can request extensions in one-year increments up to a  
            maximum of five years after January 1, 2008.  Hospitals may  
            also request extensions of up to five years if acute care  
            services will be moved to an existing conforming building,  
            relocated to a new building, or if the existing building will  
            be retrofitted to designated seismic performance categories.

          In addition to the five-year extension, the Legislature has  
            passed additional bills allowing hospitals to extend the  
            deadlines for retrofitting beyond the 2013 deadline.  SB 1661  
            (Cox, Chapter 679, Statutes of 2006), authorizes an extension  
            of up to an additional two years for hospitals that have  
            already received five-year extensions of the January 1, 2008,  
            seismic safety compliance deadline if specified criteria are  
            met, including that the hospital building is under  
            construction at the time of the request for extension and the  
            hospital is making reasonable progress toward meeting its  
            deadline, but factors beyond the hospital's control make it  
            impossible for the hospital to meet the deadline.  

            SB 306 (Ducheny, Chapter 642, Statutes of 2007), permits a  
            hospital owner to comply with seismic safety deadlines and  
            requirements in current law by replacing all of its buildings  
            subject to seismic retrofit by January 1, 2020, rather than  
            retrofitting by 2013 and replacing them by 2030, if the  
            hospital meets several conditions and OSHPD certifies that the  
            hospital owner lacks the financial capacity to meet seismic  
            standards, as defined.  Among the conditions a hospital must  
            meet to be eligible for this extension are that it maintains a  
            contract to provide Medi-Cal services, maintains a basic  
            emergency room, and is either in an underserved area, serves  
            an underserved community, is an essential provider of Medi-Cal  
            services, or is a heavy provider of services to Medi-Cal and  
            indigent patients.  Eighteen hospitals have qualified for  
            extensions to 2020 under this authority.
          
          3)Prior legislation. AB 2557 permitted a hospital located in the  
            Counties of Sacramento, San Mateo, or Santa Barbara or the  
            City of San Jose, that had received an additional extension of  
            the January 1, 2008, seismic safety requirements under  
            specified provisions of existing law to January 1, 2015, to  
            request an additional extension until September 1, 2015, in

            order to obtain either a certificate of occupancy or a  
            construction final from the Office of Statewide Health  
            Planning and Development

          SB 90 (Steinberg, Chapter 19, Statutes of 2011), allowed a  
            hospital to seek an extension for seismic compliance for its  
            SPC-1 buildings of up to seven years based on the following  
            elements: the structural integrity of the building, the loss  
            of essential hospital services to the community if the  
            hospital closed, and financial hardship.
            
            SB 499 (Ducheny, Chapter 601, Statutes of 2009), required all  
            general acute care hospitals that have SPC-1 buildings to report  
            to OSHPD by November 1, 2010, and annually thereafter, on the  
            status of their compliance with the seismic safety deadlines.

            SB 306 (Ducheny, Chapter 642, Statues of 2007), amended the Alfred  
            E. Alquist Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act to permit  
            hospitals to delay compliance with the July 1, 2008 seismic retro  
            deadline, and the 2013 extension, to the year 2020, by filing a  
            declaration with OSHPD that the owner lacks financial capacity to  
            comply with the law.

            SB 1661 (Cox, Chapter 679, Statutes of 2006), authorized an  
            extension of up to an additional two years for hospitals that had  
            already received extensions of the January 1, 2008 seismic safety  
            compliance deadline if specified criteria were met, and required  
            specified hospital reports to be posted on the OSHPD Web site.
          
          4)Support.  This bill is sponsored by the Frank R. Howard  
            Memorial Hospital (HMH), which states that it is a 25-bed  
            Critical Access Hospital located in northern Mendocino County.  
            HMH states that it has been engaged for since 2009 in the  
            design and construction of a new facility which was planned to  
            open for occupancy in advance of January 1, 2015. The  
            contractor's written construction schedule, in place through  
            the summer of 2014, called for substantial completion of HMH's  
            new facility in early October 2014, which would have given the  
            hospital time to open in advance of January 1, 2015. In  
            mid-September 2014, HMH states that the contractor, citing  
            unanticipated construction delays, provided HMH with a new  
            schedule reflecting completion of construction in mid-January  
            2015, which was later pushed back into the spring. HMH notes  
            that last year, five hospital construction projects were  
            identified as working toward the January 1, 2015 deadline, but

            due to extenuating circumstances, were not likely to be  
            completed in time. Legislation was passed to allow these five  
            hospitals to request an additional eight-month extension, and  
            that this bill is seeking to provide HMH with this same  
            ability. Adventist Health, and Loma Linda University Medical  
            Center state in support that HMH is an important health care  
            provider in northern Mendocino County, with more than 80  
            percent of the hospital's inpatient payor mix is a combination  
            of Medicare and Medi-Cal, and that non-compliance with seismic  
            deadlines could cause a hospital to lose its license. The  
            California Hospital Association states in support that many  
            designers and structural engineers consider California  
            hospitals to be the most complex and costly buildings to  
            construct due to the intricate structural, mechanical,  
            plumbing and electrical systems needed to remain operational  
            following an earthquake.
