My final comment and question is being former law enforcement I'm very sensitive to the ongoing national discussion about police and community relations. This past fall I attended four funerals in less than a month for officers killed violently in the line of duty. One funeral was for Lancaster Deputy Sergeant Steve Owen from my district who was killed while responding to a burglary. Another was for a Palm Springs officer who had just returned from maternity leave, Ms. Lesley Zerebny. Nationally, we've seen attacks targeting officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, and since being elected I've had regular meetings with community members and community leaders, and law enforcement, to discuss how we can build trust back., These meetings provide important perspective and have helped me better understand why some people in the community distrust law enforcement. However, with the number of attacks on officers we have seen, it's clear we need to do everything in our power to reduce tensions and improve trust. Do you see a role for California's Attorney General to improve police-community relations and do you have thoughts about the steps we can take?","Trust comes after there's respect and without the respect, you'll never gain the trust and you won't get the cooperation, if you don't have the trust and so, from my perspective we almost have to start at the A, B, C's here, because communities have become very divided. I believe the law enforcement community has to do more to reach out to communities that have seen victims as a result of ambitious law enforcement activity and I believe communities that have been the victims have to reach out to the law enforcement to try to get a sense of how difficult the job has become with the technology and the capacity of weapons these days and so I think we have to go back to the first step of respect. Before we can get to trust, we'll never get to cooperation if we can't do the first two.","Thank you, Dr. Weber. Thank you. Mr. Lackey?",9688053,9688028,"[9688048, 9688051]",16589

Concern was of course was a lot of traffic, the Apple, the congestion that's already in Silicon Valley and so forth., The citizens petition was responded to by the developer By applying for a initiative to approve a development that was somewhat different, and without a lot of the controls and mitigations that was imposed on the original permit granted by the city., So we had two initiatives that were placed on the ballot. Both initiatives, because they were placed on the ballot, didn't have to have any kind of sequel review or anything like that. The community was in a turmoil for two years, I think almost every single one in the city had either a vote yes and vote no or vote no and vote yes., And there were signs all over the City of Cupertino, yes no, or no yes. And the voters eventually voted last November, the way I hoped they would vote, which was a no, no. They rejected both initiatives. However, what I'm going to say is, it created a chaotic and confusing and inappropriate land use decision process that divided the community. Okay, it's reality. So the way we go forward on this with hopefully a good project,, a project that will hopefully be a benefit to our community, I don't know how we're going to go forward. So, these initiatives, they create chaos. Chaos in the land use process because political environment that we have today, whether it's the action, there's going to be a reaction. So, I want to know how does your bill help us in our community? And when people say there's very little that this will be the effect. I think this is a big deal, it was for my district., I mean, it created a huge impact on my district, okay? A huge impact. And it has nothing to do with advocating for affordable housing, or any of those kinds of things., It has to do with having a land use plan that hopefully will be a stable plan that everybody will follow. That every time you don't like some decision you go off and you do spend literally millions of dollars in a City of 40,000 people. Millions, you know this happens. So in campaigning one way or the other to convince voters. But anyway, that's the story I wanted to tell you., I want to hear what, how your bill helps create a more stable environment, so when we do plans we have a plan that lasts for a long time that's not amended too much. That's my goal. I want to have a land use plan that doesn't change too much. It's approved by the City Council and it doesn't change too much. That's what we want. Otherwise, we don't really have a plan because the plan can be changed any time by a number of ways and there's no real planning going on., So the state law is to encourage planning that's stable, that's consistent, that creates an even playing field. So I'm giving you my experience with the City of Cupertino. I wanted to hear how your bill would help, now it may be the other side can comment as well.","Thank you, Senator, thank you very much.

I got to start out by just saying that it creeps me out, you're a- all these toys. I don't know if they're watching me right now. So, I'm kind of, we're having a bit of a face off. The intent of the bill, I completely agree with, especially when it comes to teddies and toasters., And the toy industry's concerns frankly, I'm not particularly sympathetic to on the labeling issue. I think, if a toy out there is capable of recording what you do that ought to be notice to consumers and that ought to be clear on the packaging. We have to make room for that., So, I'm concerned about a proliferation of these kind of devices. I think, some of the concerns I have are about more the examples that Miss Gladstein brought up in terms of the scope of this bill. And so, when you have your Waze app, your car, a smart meter, these kinds of technologies. I'm just trying to get more clarity before this bill moves forward in terms of your intent., Because, I know, this has sort of evolved quickly. So, I want to just ask you a few questions and see if we can get a little more clarity, because it sounds like you've already taken significant amendments, and I appreciate you working on that. But I just want to sort of hone in., Because I still want to be able to use my iPad and my iPhone and, I want my car to be able to talk to another car and some people at a policy level just don't want that, but I guess I see more upside and a way to mitigate that risk and I think you're open to that too, from our conversations but, so just to clear a few issues. So one in the amend you took,, you talked about limiting the definition to this notion of a stated functionality of a connected device. So, the design of a device or the necessity to obtain consent on those devices. But, I'm trying to sort of figure out what the stated functionality of the devices you guys are contemplating in this., So, is that an iPhone with an app on it? What is the devices, is the device the app or is the device the phone? Same in this biometric context. Like if you have a glycemic index indicator., Is that the stated functionality of say a Fitbit that also can check your glycemic indexes. Is the Fitbit for the stated functionality up to the manufacture to say, this is just about tracking your steps or is it really about some other information they may be collecting. So that's the first one., Second one on geolocation issues, I want to get clarity on does this sort of encompass when two vehicles are communicating with each other? Or back to a sort of Waze app, where they're upcoming traffic situations? Is that sort of contemplating within the scope, and do you want to regulate that., And in other words, do you want there to be a semi-frequent or how frequent of a notification you say a driver, when that's recording your information. So say your Waze is on and it is letting you know, it's tracking sort of your location at the time., Is that at red light on all the time like, in your mind say what is that notification look like.nd then the final question was really about how this matches up with existing laws. So, there are some existing security requirements in the civil code that I wanted to get clear, how this bill differs or if the intent is really to be consistent with that existing part of the Civil Code., So, in 1798, we did our own notes because industry hasn't really been engaging on the amendment front at this point. It seems more like there's a bit of an impasse at this point, but hopefully we can start to break that up today. But the amendment says, they want, the devices to be equipped with reasonable security features appropriate to the nature of the device, that's in the amend. But the existing law has a section in that code that also says that, any business that owns a license or maintains information about California residents, must implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information collected., So, is the intent for the bill to be broader than that? More inexpensive? Consistent with that? Because it is right in the same section of the code., So I just want a clarity on some of those issues so we can sort of scope this thing out and just figure out, is this really about teddies and toasters, or is it also about iPhones and cars? Because the teddies and toasters point is troubling, I think we ought to shut down those practices of being able to automatically record and, there ought to be some recourse in existing law, but if we need to do more there, great., But, it's the other devices that concern me the most, I'd say. Yeah, Kayla, I'm not a fan. I don't like. Well let's start. She's already creeping me out.","Let's start with the existing law, the Civil Code.
