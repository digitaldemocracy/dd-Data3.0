I see the issue on both sides because in my experience in the EMS, it's kind of funny, a lot of the folks from Southern California, I've been to a lot of those facilities, so I've seen firsthand what you go through the day to day operations whether it's in the morning, noon, or night., The patients that are in these facilities need the best care possible. And we're looking at one way to address it. But I think we've gotta look at how do we make this more of a profession?, How do we make it so it's not a high turnover rate where these CNAs kind of get tired of their job, don't feel appreciated because the way they're being treated or pray whatever that., So it's a combination of everything. But I think we're going in the right direction. Assembly Member Calderon I appreciate your bill. I look forward to helping you with that and I like once again I would urge folks to really see what they do their jobs, because I've been there in many of these places., Assembly talked about that lift, lifting patients. I've helped some of you CNA's back in Southern California with that lift, because you didn't have any help to take that patient out of bed, or put in him bed., And when I was there bringing somebody, taking somebody I've seen first hand how difficult it is and some of the stings you're required to do, you need more than just one body to help you.

And what is lost to inform decision makers and the public about the impacts of projects to identify ways to avoid or significantly reduce environmental damage,..., ...prevent environmental damage by requiring feasible alternatives for mitigation measures, disclose to the public reasons why an agency approved the project, if significant environmental effects are involved, and involve public agencies in the process, and increase public participation in the environmental review and planning process., And, in the circumstance that you mentioned, Senator Stone, if you have an invasive species that is having a detrimental impact, I suspect that the public is going to want to be there to support any efforts to try to result in the necessary remediation or whatever it is that the proposal asks for., So, I mean, in talking about renewable energy, it is, we're all excited about it, but that doesn't mean that renewable energy projects shouldn't have to go through CEQA like everyone else., Just because something goes through CEQA doesn't mean that it's condemned, or that it's going to be prolonged for, you know, forever.

I don't think it's an issue that is a easy one. Okay, I'm just saying that in my district, we have a company called Apple. Apple has built the, I think it's now the biggest single structure and it's opening up later this year, in California. Biggest single structure in California to be their corporate headquarters, in Cupertino., See, Cupertino approves the Apple building. Surely they're after it was approved, and while the Apple building was under construction, the shopping center across the street, across the freeway, the 280 freeway. It's named Valco shopping center. Applied to the City of Cupertino which is about 40,000 people in the City of Cupertino. Very wealthy community. You look at the income. It's in the westerly part of San Jose., Applied for a planned development rezoning and development permit to create a multi-million square feet a mixed use development, including revitalizing or redoing the shopping center, putting housing, commercial activity, and so forth., It became controversial in the City of Cupertino. The City Council reviewed and approved the project with some specific mitigation measures after an EIR was done on the project. However, what happened was the citizens of Cupertino had a petition that would change the project in deny the project. The signatures were collected. I think it had some things like it would limit the height of any building in Cupertino to three stories., There's all kind of development restrictions in the citizens' initiative in response to this project. Concern was of course was a lot of traffic, the Apple, the congestion that's already in Silicon Valley and so forth., The citizens petition was responded to by the developer By applying for a initiative to approve a development that was somewhat different, and without a lot of the controls and mitigations that was imposed on the original permit granted by the city., So we had two initiatives that were placed on the ballot. Both initiatives, because they were placed on the ballot, didn't have to have any kind of sequel review or anything like that. The community was in a turmoil for two years, I think almost every single one in the city had either a vote yes and vote no or vote no and vote yes., And there were signs all over the City of Cupertino, yes no, or no yes. And the voters eventually voted last November, the way I hoped they would vote, which was a no, no. They rejected both initiatives. However, what I'm going to say is, it created a chaotic and confusing and inappropriate land use decision process that divided the community. Okay, it's reality. So the way we go forward on this with hopefully a good project,, a project that will hopefully be a benefit to our community, I don't know how we're going to go forward. So, these initiatives, they create chaos. Chaos in the land use process because political environment that we have today, whether it's the action, there's going to be a reaction. So, I want to know how does your bill help us in our community? And when people say there's very little that this will be the effect. I think this is a big deal, it was for my district., I mean, it created a huge impact on my district, okay? A huge impact. And it has nothing to do with advocating for affordable housing, or any of those kinds of things., It has to do with having a land use plan that hopefully will be a stable plan that everybody will follow. That every time you don't like some decision you go off and you do spend literally millions of dollars in a City of 40,000 people. Millions, you know this happens. So in campaigning one way or the other to convince voters. But anyway, that's the story I wanted to tell you., I want to hear what, how your bill helps create a more stable environment, so when we do plans we have a plan that lasts for a long time that's not amended too much. That's my goal. I want to have a land use plan that doesn't change too much. It's approved by the City Council and it doesn't change too much. That's what we want. Otherwise, we don't really have a plan because the plan can be changed any time by a number of ways and there's no real planning going on., So the state law is to encourage planning that's stable, that's consistent, that creates an even playing field.

My final comment and question is being former law enforcement I'm very sensitive to the ongoing national discussion about police and community relations. This past fall I attended four funerals in less than a month for officers killed violently in the line of duty. One funeral was for Lancaster Deputy Sergeant Steve Owen from my district who was killed while responding to a burglary. Another was for a Palm Springs officer who had just returned from maternity leave, Ms. Lesley Zerebny. Nationally, we've seen attacks targeting officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, and since being elected I've had regular meetings with community members and community leaders, and law enforcement, to discuss how we can build trust back., These meetings provide important perspective and have helped me better understand why some people in the community distrust law enforcement. However, with the number of attacks on officers we have seen, it's clear we need to do everything in our power to reduce tensions and improve trust. Do you see a role for California's Attorney General to improve police-community relations and do you have thoughts about the steps we can take?","Trust comes after there's respect and without the respect, you'll never gain the trust and you won't get the cooperation, if you don't have the trust and so, from my perspective we almost have to start at the A, B, C's here, because communities have become very divided. I believe the law enforcement community has to do more to reach out to communities that have seen victims as a result of ambitious law enforcement activity and I believe communities that have been the victims have to reach out to the law enforcement to try to get a sense of how difficult the job has become with the technology and the capacity of weapons these days and so I think we have to go back to the first step of respect. Before we can get to trust, we'll never get to cooperation if we can't do the first two.","{9688048, 9688051}",16589,False

Mr. Chair and members, I'm here today to present to you AB 1323. A bill relating to long-term water use efficiency. With 18 bills on your special order of business this morning relating to long-term water use efficiency., It is clear there is a strong interest in continuing to make advancement in California's well-established water conservation and water use efficiency ethics. Communities throughout the state have their own stories, about how well they have done in advancing water conservation over the past several years. In San Diego, County, through implementation of successful water use efficiency programs via wholesale and retail water agencies. We've been able to reduce per capita consumption of water by 40% since 1990., Even while growing our regional population by 800,000 residents during the same period of time. Since 1990, in San Diego County alone, our residents have installed more than 530,000 ultra-low flush and high efficiency toilets. More than 100,000 high-efficiency clothes washers,, and more than 600,000 water-shaving shower heads. Additionally, our region has also embarked upon significant local water supply development. To insulate our communities from the negative effects of long-term drought. Including aggressive water recycling, and advancement of purification water/, The drinking water programs, desalinization, and surface storage improvement. AB 1323 charts a compromised approach toward making meaningful progress on establishing a long-term water use efficiency ethics for California. AB 1323 proposes to take the good concepts from Assemblymember Rubio's bills and the good concepts from Assemblymember Friedman's bills along with the good concepts outlining, the administration's framework report for making conservation a way of life in California. And put the right folks together in a room to develop a facilitated consensus approach to developing long term water use efficiency standards and performance measures. Important AB 1323 also provides legislative oversight by requiring that the recommendations developed through the stakeholder process outlined in my bill., Are then sent to the Legislature so they can be codified through the conventional legislative process. This is a tried and true method for addressing highly complex issues such as those facing us today in the area of water use efficiency. Here to speak concerning AB 1323 is Glenn Farrell from the San Diego County Water Authority.","Good morning Mr. Chair and Members, Glenn Farrell San Diego County Water Authority.

So, have you made adjustments in that 700 to 1,200. What kind of a deal is that for hunters and fisher persons in the State of California?, And then you've got a sliding scale there, right? I'm just curious about the administrative challenges of doing some kind of a sliding scale for landing fee increases based on the year. You were talking about sensitivity around a lousy salmon year and we're hitting them with the same fee regardless., Is there any kind of flexibility contemplated which is a more sensitive one given the nature of the economy and what kind of a fishing year it is?

So now, just identify what you have to do now., Now you have to do a study, basically a CEQA amendment study.

And at a time when we really need the construction jobs and we need housing for certainly many areas that I represent. Where more than 40% of certain populations rent, and they would like to own., The problem is that there is not a whole lot of development going on right now.

For developers, which we are going to pass the cost on to the home builder., If it's an affordable home builder, it's going to be more difficult to make it affordable.

There's a provision in Mr. Herzberg's bill from the same year, 2001, or is it 2000? 2000, and actually we had worked together on putting that provision in on making sure that there was water available in a timely manner for those projects.","{4735474, 4735482, 4735484, 4735478, 4735486}",6067,False
58,58.0,False,Not In Committee,False,7.0,11309.0,False,False,True,General Public,"Absolutely. So really the point of this bill is to understand that if you're chronically homeless, as society we spend money to help you move from your position of being chronically homeless. And we spend, we believe, many, many more dollars through the healthcare system because we address the needs of a homeless, a chronically homeless person, after the fact when they're cycling through emergency rooms, when they're going through jail health services, going through various inpatient treatment services. The MediCal system spends, we believe, likely $2,500 more per month because we only look at the needs of a chronically homeless person through the lens of healthcare. What this bill is about is really saying, why don't we invest in support of housing the idea of putting a roof over someone's head, with supportive services before they become chronically homeless, or as we take them off the street because that is not just a more humane way of addressing the situation it's actually more cost effective., There have, in fact, I referenced a study, the $2,500 figure per month of what is saved in healthcare costs if you take this approach. That came from a study I know Sharron report, who is an expert on these issues and the state has looked at this before. It is based on studies that have been done elsewhere. And our hope is with this pilot we can track a cohort of chronically homeless individuals on MediCal. To understand what is it costing the state to just provide healthcare versus if we were to provide rental assistance and supportive services. Would we see a drop in what we have to spend while actually seeing better outcomes? And I don't know if you'd like to elaborate on studies that are out there.","Sure. There have actually been over 30 studies across the country that show consistently this trend toward decreased costs when you get somebody housed. I think probably the most prominent city comes from Chicago. They actually did a randomized control group study that showed very consistent findings with the findings that Assembly Member Chui just reported. But there are others including some that I mentioned that show between $7,000 and and $30,000 a year. Just in savings to publicly funded healthcare systems.

The driver left this little girl lying in the street with several serious injuries. She spent her 7th birthday in a hospital bed awaiting a future of reconstructive surgeries and extensive rehabilitation., The driver was arrested a few days later. His future has yet to be decided by a judge. Believe it or not, under California's current penalty structure, he could possibly settle in court and get off with a couple $100 fine., And that's it. Hit and runs occur in all of our districts, leaving families torn apart with nothing to turn to, but unjust laws. The bill applies specifically to hit and run drivers who injure an individual, but, either enter into a plea bargain agreement where the sentence is reduced to a hit-and-run only with property damage. Under current law the driver can settle in court with only having to a couple $100 fine. AB 2088 corrects this injustice by requiring hit-and-run drivers who are involved in a collision where there was injury involved to either perform community service or, adhere to the terms of a licensed suspension. The idea behind this bill has been vetted for over a year and a half, and I wish that I could claim full credit, but the language I present to you today has truly been a bipartisan effort. While some concern still may exist over limiting court's discretion,, I want to stress that the court now has three penalty options ranging from a couple hours of community service to six months worth of license suspension. So that yes, the court already has the discretion to suspend an offender's license or require community service in these case scenarios, but we will need this bill to guarantee that a hit and run drivers are adequately held accountable to the suffering that they cause., So with me is Damian Kevitt who will share his personal story as a victim of hit and run and how his experience inspired him to start up a non-profit named Streets are for Everyone or SAFE, for short.","Committee Member, thank you for taking a moment to listen to me.

However, recent actions by DHCS have resulted in the elimination of an automated web-based newborn hearing tracking system,, that was effective and proven to lessen the loss to follow up of newborns. Since December 1st of 2016, DHCS has replaced this system and reverted back to an inferior manual system that consists of hand written forms or pre-populated forms that are emailed or faxed, This is a great concern to me because it clearly creates a negative impact on newborn children who are lost to identification for hearing loss as a result of DHCS decision to revert to a manual tracking system.

SB 572 requires school districts to appoint an advisory committee, made up of parents, students, teachers, and a cross section of the community that advise a district before closing a school., Despite the lack of data, our conversations with stakeholders indicates that many school districts already use advisory committees for school closures, as recommended by the Depart of Education. Therefore, SB 572 would not require these school districts to do more than they're already doing, and that would not increase their costs., However, for school districts that do not do this, this is an important investment because of the severe economic consequences of closing a school. Particularly for low socioeconomic communities., School closures, fortunately, are very rare occurrences in California, so the use of the advisory committee would also be rare, would not impose any high recurring costs. Overall, the high cost and severity of closing a school far outweighs the cost of establishing a district advisory committee., District advisory committees benefits the school closure process because they help the school district conduct the comprehensive impact study that includes projected cost savings and fiscal analysis. This helps school districts make their final decision and can limit the negative fiscal effects caused by school closure., SB 572 will help ensure that those most effected by a school closure have a voice at the table, and work together with the school district to determine the best course of action to help their children during this difficult period without financially burdening the school district.

Research shows that students who do more reading at home are better readers throughout their life and have higher math scores., The facts are that if a child does not read at grade level by fourth grade, there's a 75% chance that child never will read at grade level.

I want to first thank the Chair for the time that she's afforded me and many of the supporters on this project to discuss where we are. Thank you for this hearing this morning., This bill is about Inglewood and a commitment to defeat the urban decline, and build economic benefits to the residents and the economy, and the community, I should say, to become an economic hub for the state. It's about making dreams come true, in a city that many had written off for the last 20 years., That's what has brought, the visionary leadership has brought the Rams, the Chargers, to successfully negotiate a State of the art football stadium and the revitalization of the form, making it the number one concert venue in the State of California at this time. We have continued to move Inglewood forward with this new agreement with the Los Angeles Clippers., SB 789 will streamline the CEQA for the city and citizens can be rewarded with the benefits of an exciting new venue. Historically, the Legislature and the Governor have granted CEQA Exemptions and streamline for football stadiums, basketball arenas, renewable energy projects, large tech companies, water projects, high rises, and even prisons., So this is nothing new for a Committee such as this sort of the legislative body to discuss. Yes, I'm asking for this Committee to approve a CEQA bill This CEQA bill builds the City of Inglewood, will help the City of Inglewood build a state of the art arena where I have family and friends who've lived there for over 40 years and they're excited about what's coming forward here with this project., What makes this bill different from all the other previous CEQA bills related is that it directly benefits a black and brown community, constituents with local jobs, reduce reliance on cars and higher property values. We've seen that In the last 18 months in Inglewood, the excitement that's going on in that city now., It's important for me to reinforce it. This bill does not exempt the sports and entertainment venues from CEQA review. In fact there's an environmental impact report that's already been completed and approved for further revitalization project and additional EIRs will be completed if this bill is enacted., As for the Inglewood transit project, this would reduce air pollutants, toxic air contaminants, greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the reliance on personal automobiles and create public transit ridership to the LA Forum, to the LA Clippers, the Rams and Charger Stadium., SB 789 is absolutely critical for the economic vitality and public health of the constituents in the City of Inglewood, which I represent, and the entire LA region. This bill has broad community support, labor, and public agencies. And I thank you for your time.

I got to start out by just saying that it creeps me out, you're a- all these toys. I don't know if they're watching me right now. So, I'm kind of, we're having a bit of a face off. The intent of the bill, I completely agree with, especially when it comes to teddies and toasters., And the toy industry's concerns frankly, I'm not particularly sympathetic to on the labeling issue. I think, if a toy out there is capable of recording what you do that ought to be notice to consumers and that ought to be clear on the packaging. We have to make room for that., So, I'm concerned about a proliferation of these kind of devices. I think, some of the concerns I have are about more the examples that Miss Gladstein brought up in terms of the scope of this bill. And so, when you have your Waze app, your car, a smart meter, these kinds of technologies. I'm just trying to get more clarity before this bill moves forward in terms of your intent., Because, I know, this has sort of evolved quickly. So, I want to just ask you a few questions and see if we can get a little more clarity, because it sounds like you've already taken significant amendments, and I appreciate you working on that. But I just want to sort of hone in., Because I still want to be able to use my iPad and my iPhone and, I want my car to be able to talk to another car and some people at a policy level just don't want that, but I guess I see more upside and a way to mitigate that risk and I think you're open to that too, from our conversations but, so just to clear a few issues. So one in the amend you took,, you talked about limiting the definition to this notion of a stated functionality of a connected device. So, the design of a device or the necessity to obtain consent on those devices. But, I'm trying to sort of figure out what the stated functionality of the devices you guys are contemplating in this., So, is that an iPhone with an app on it? What is the devices, is the device the app or is the device the phone? Same in this biometric context. Like if you have a glycemic index indicator., Is that the stated functionality of say a Fitbit that also can check your glycemic indexes. Is the Fitbit for the stated functionality up to the manufacture to say, this is just about tracking your steps or is it really about some other information they may be collecting. So that's the first one., Second one on geolocation issues, I want to get clarity on does this sort of encompass when two vehicles are communicating with each other? Or back to a sort of Waze app, where they're upcoming traffic situations? Is that sort of contemplating within the scope, and do you want to regulate that., And in other words, do you want there to be a semi-frequent or how frequent of a notification you say a driver, when that's recording your information. So say your Waze is on and it is letting you know, it's tracking sort of your location at the time., Is that at red light on all the time like, in your mind say what is that notification look like.nd then the final question was really about how this matches up with existing laws. So, there are some existing security requirements in the civil code that I wanted to get clear, how this bill differs or if the intent is really to be consistent with that existing part of the Civil Code., So, in 1798, we did our own notes because industry hasn't really been engaging on the amendment front at this point. It seems more like there's a bit of an impasse at this point, but hopefully we can start to break that up today. But the amendment says, they want, the devices to be equipped with reasonable security features appropriate to the nature of the device, that's in the amend. But the existing law has a section in that code that also says that, any business that owns a license or maintains information about California residents, must implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information collected., So, is the intent for the bill to be broader than that? More inexpensive? Consistent with that? Because it is right in the same section of the code., So I just want a clarity on some of those issues so we can sort of scope this thing out and just figure out, is this really about teddies and toasters, or is it also about iPhones and cars? Because the teddies and toasters point is troubling, I think we ought to shut down those practices of being able to automatically record and, there ought to be some recourse in existing law, but if we need to do more there, great., Personal information., Well, just to be clear on that one, nothing's referenced there. It just says appropriate to the nature of the information. So there's a sort of a reasonable standard governing the current Civil Code on that one, right?

VSOs allow those who have bravely served this great country in any of the branches of the US military, to access programs and services, find support and friendship and help re-engage in their communities., It's crucial that these organizations which support those who have served, be provided the necessary tools to aid the two million veterans who call California home, and that number grows by 30,000 per year., SB 685 is a bipartisan proposal, that will allow veterans service organizations to host the general public, when holding events that serve alcohol, at their organization's establishment. This would be focused on beer and wine., The current alcohol license arrangement only allows a veteran and their one guest to be served alcohol hosted at the VSO's building or hall. This proposal will generate more revenue for VSOs, and will allow them to expand services for veterans into complete repairs and upkeep on aging veteran halls across this state., To be clear, this bill will not make veteran halls de facto bars, as only beer and wine would be allowed to serve at the time of the event, per the license, to the public, and not only in, only at specific events within their establishments., VSOs will still need to apply for an alcohol license, and all training requirements for bartenders will still apply.

The driver left this little girl lying in the street with several serious injuries. She spent her 7th birthday in a hospital bed awaiting a future of reconstructive surgeries and extensive rehabilitation., The driver was arrested a few days later. His future has yet to be decided by a judge. Believe it or not, under California's current penalty structure, he could possibly settle in court and get off with a couple $100 fine., And that's it. Hit and runs occur in all of our districts, leaving families torn apart with nothing to turn to, but unjust laws. The bill applies specifically to hit and run drivers who injure an individual, but, either enter into a plea bargain agreement where the sentence is reduced to a hit-and-run only with property damage. Under current law the driver can settle in court with only having to a couple $100 fine. AB 2088 corrects this injustice by requiring hit-and-run drivers who are involved in a collision where there was injury involved to either perform community service or, adhere to the terms of a licensed suspension. The idea behind this bill has been vetted for over a year and a half, and I wish that I could claim full credit, but the language I present to you today has truly been a bipartisan effort. While some concern still may exist over limiting court's discretion,, I want to stress that the court now has three penalty options ranging from a couple hours of community service to six months worth of license suspension.

Currently, state law has deadlines to initiate a complaint of an investigation., But there is no legislation for completing investigations. And again, being new to San Francisco, meeting people coming into my office, one of the complaints I have heard is the amount of time it takes to issue complaints. Sometimes exceeding 500 days, which puts the public at risk., What are you doing to make sure that we issue those citations in a timely way? Or at least let the institution know that there is major issues that we're concerned about, that they're putting the public at risk?","We do acknowledge that we have a backlog in issuing the citations. When our nurse surveyor team leaves a facility, we do at that time notify the facility of an intent to site and then the delay comes afterwards because that citation, to ensure that it meets legal standards, goes through multiple reviews. There's usually a physician, or there's often a physician or another consultant involved in reviewing the work of the survey team.","{2321096, 2299984, 2299982}",2030,False

So really the point of this bill is to understand that if you're chronically homeless, as society we spend money to help you move from your position of being chronically homeless. And we spend, we believe, many, many more dollars through the healthcare system because we address the needs of a homeless, a chronically homeless person, after the fact when they're cycling through emergency rooms, when they're going through jail health services, going through various inpatient treatment services. The MediCal system spends, we believe, likely $2,500 more per month because we only look at the needs of a chronically homeless person through the lens of healthcare. What this bill is about is really saying, why don't we invest in support of housing the idea of putting a roof over someone's head, with supportive services before they become chronically homeless, or as we take them off the street because that is not just a more humane way of addressing the situation it's actually more cost effective., There have, in fact, I referenced a study, the $2,500 figure per month of what is saved in healthcare costs if you take this approach. That came from a study I know Sharron report, who is an expert on these issues and the state has looked at this before. It is based on studies that have been done elsewhere. And our hope is with this pilot we can track a cohort of chronically homeless individuals on MediCal. To understand what is it costing the state to just provide healthcare versus if we were to provide rental assistance and supportive services. Would we see a drop in what we have to spend while actually seeing better outcomes? And I don't know if you'd like to elaborate on studies that are out there.","Sure. There have actually been over 30 studies across the country that show consistently this trend toward decreased costs when you get somebody housed. I think probably the most prominent city comes from Chicago. They actually did a randomized control group study that showed very consistent findings with the findings that Assembly Member Chui just reported. But there are others including some that I mentioned that show between $7,000 and and $30,000 a year. Just in savings to publicly funded healthcare systems. And then of course there's savings in decreasing correction costs and other costs to our publicly funded systems.","{14667625, 14667619}",30093,False

Under existing law, all dogs seized in connection with animal fighting convictions are automatically labeled as vicious. The vicious label is a death sentence for these dogs. AB 1825 would simply ensure that animal professionals individually evaluate these dogs to determine whether they can be rehabilitated to safely re-enter society, or need to be placed in sanctuaries or euthanized if deemed absolutely necessary. California is one of only 11 states that still mandates this automatic designation., I'm happy to co-op this bill with my colleague, Assemblymember Maienschein. In light of the high profile case of dogs seized from the property of NFL player, Michael Vick, 48 of the 49 seized dogs were evaluated positively. And some even became therapy or service dogs., None of these dogs have been involved in incidents that would deem them vicious under revisions of existing law. 1825 is a bipartisan piece of legislation that will allow animal fighting victims to be judged by their own health and behavior and given the opportunity to live a cruelty free life. I have here two witnesses, one from the California Animal Control Directors' Association and the other from the Stockton Animal Services.","Thank you, Members of the Committee, for allowing me to speak on behalf of Stockton Animal Services, a municipal animal shelter operated by the City of Stockton. My name is Phillip Zimmerman, and after nearly two decades with the Stockton Police Department, I became the manager of Stockton Animal Shelter in early 2015.

There are different options through DMV fees and so forth, but I think the legislatures looked at those at a whole.
