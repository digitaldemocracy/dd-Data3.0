SUMMARY
:
  
Makes several significant changes to the Political Reform Act (PRA) of 1974.  
Specifically, 
this bill
:  
 
1)
 
Increases the thresholds at which a public official's financial interest can potentially create a 
conflict of interest under the PRA, as follows:
 
a)
 
From $2,000 to $10,000 for interests in real property;
 
b)
 
From $2,000 to $5,000 for in
vestments in a business entity; and,
 
c)
 
From $500 to $1,000, for sources of income, other than gifts or specified loans.
 
2)
 
Revises the monetary ranges that specified public officials or candidates, when filing a 
statement of economic interests (SEI), use to des
cribe the value of their investments, interests 
in real property, and income.
 
3)
 
Requires a public official or candidate who is required to disclose a business entity 
investment on his or her SEI because the official or candidate is a director, officer, partn
er, or 
trustee of the entity, to provide a thorough and detailed description of the entity's activities 
and disclose the names of all business partners who share a financial interest in the entity on 
the official or candidate's SEI, based on criteria estab
lished by the Fair Political Practices 
Commission (FPPC). 
 
4)
 
Requires a public official or candidate who is required to disclose his or her pro rata share of 
income to a business entity on an SEI to include a thorough and detailed description of the 
business
 
activity of the business entity, instead of a general description of the entity
'
s 
business activity.
 
5)
 
Requires a public official who holds an office listed in Government Code Section 87200 to 
disclose on his or her SEI, as specified, each governmental deci
sion for which a financial 
interest resulted in the official's disqualification from making, participating in making, or in 
any way attempting to use his or her official position to influence a governmental decision.
 
The Senate amendments
:
 
1)
 
Delete provision
s of the bill that would have made behested payment reporting requirements 
applicable to candidates who are not elected officials, and to elected officials for a year after 
leaving office.

2)
 
Provide that detailed descriptions of a business entity's activitie
s and a disclosure of the 
names of business partners who share a financial interest in a business entity are not required 
to be included on an SEI if the business entity is publicly traded.
 
3)
 
Add an additional disclosure tier on the SEI for describing the va
lue of investments, interests 
in real property, and income.
 
4)
 
Make technical and corresponding changes.
 
5)
 
Add double
-
joining language to avoid chaptering problems with SB 21 (Hill) of the current 
legislative session.
 
FISCAL EFFECT
:  
According to the Senate App
ropriations Committee, the FPPC indicates 
that this bill would result in a one
-
time General Fund cost of $260,000. 
 
Ongoing costs would 
total about $130,000 per year.
 
COMMENTS
:  

thresho
lds that necessitate a public official excusing him or herself from a governmental 

middle tiers and upper tiers in the financial disclosures on the FPPC's Form 700,
 
ensuring that 
the public has a more accurate view of the financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest 

specifically a more thorough description of any busin
esses and the names of any business 

specify any instances in the previous year where a financial interest has been cause for a recusal 
from being involved with
 
or making a governmental decision."
 
As part of the PRA's comprehensive scheme to prevent conflicts of interest by state and local 
public officials, existing law identifies certain elected and other high
-
level state and local 
officials who must file SEIs. 
 
Similarly, candidates for those positions must file SEIs.  Other 
state and local public officials and employees are required to file SEIs if the position they hold 
entails the making or participation in the making of governmental decisions that may forese
eably 
have a material financial effect on the decision maker's financial interests.
 
California voters passed an 
initiative, Proposition 9, in 
1974 that created the FPPC and 
codified 
significant re
strictions and prohibitions on 
candidates, officeholders and
 
lobbyists. 
That initiative 
is commonly known as the PRA.  
Amend
ments to the PRA 
that are not submitted to the v
oters, 
such as those contained 
in this bill, 
must further the purposes of the initiative and 
require a 
two
-
thirds vote of both houses of the 
Leg
islature.
 
The Senate amendments delete provisions of the bill that would have expanded behested 
payment reporting requirements to candidates who are not elected officials and to elected 
officials for a year after leaving office.  Additionally, the Senate a
mendments narrow the scope 
of information that must be disclosed on SEIs about businesses that are publicly traded, and 
further revise the monetary ranges used on the SEI to describe the value of investments, interests 
in real property, and income.  This b
ill, as amended in the Senate, is consistent with Assembly 
actions.

GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE
:
 
This bill makes several changes to the Political Reform Act of 1974, including significant 
changes to reporting requirements on statements of economic interests.
 
The Political Reform Act already requires public officials to disclose their income, investments 
and business activities with enough particularity so that conflicts of interest can be identified.  
This bill adds yet more complexity to existing reporting r
equirements without commensurate 
benefit, and I am not convinced that this bill will provide more useful information to the public.
