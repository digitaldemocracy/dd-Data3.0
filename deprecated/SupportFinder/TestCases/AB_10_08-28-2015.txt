           SUBJECT:   Political Reform Act of 1974: behested payments and  
                     economic interest disclosures


          SOURCE:    Author
          
          DIGEST:   This bill makes several significant changes to the  
          Political Reform Act (PRA) of 1974 including changes to  
          reporting requirements on statements of economic interests  
          (SEI). 
          
          ANALYSIS:   

          Existing law:

          1)Prohibits a public official from making, participating in  
            making, or in any way attempting to use his official position  
            to influence a governmental decision in which the official  
            knows or has reason to know he or she has a financial  








                                                                      AB 10 <u>

            interest, as specified.  Provides that an official has a  
            financial interest in a decision, for these purposes, if it is  
            reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material  
            financial effect, distinguishable from its effect on the  
            public generally, on the official, a member of his or her  
            immediate family, or on any of the following: 



             a)   Any business entity in which the public official has a  
               direct or indirect investment worth $2,000 or more; 



             b)   Any business entity in which the public official is a  
               director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or holds any  
               position of management; or,



             c)   Any real property in which the public official has a  
               direct or indirect interest worth $2,000 or more; 



             d)   Any source of income (except gifts or loans by a  
               commercial lending institution made in the regular course  
               of business on terms available to the public without regard  
               to official status) aggregating $500 or more in value  
               provided or promised to, received by, the public official  
               within 12 months prior to the time when the decision is  
               made; 



             e)   Any donor of, or any intermediary or agent for a donor  
               of, a gift or gifts aggregating an amount that equals or  
               exceeds the gift limit (currently $460 in a year) that is  
               provided to, received by, or promised to the public  
               official within 12 months prior to the time when the  
               decision is made.

          2)Requires candidates for, and current holders of, specified  
            elected or appointed state and local offices and designated  
            employees of state and local agencies to file SEIs disclosing  
            their financial interests, including investments, real  
            property interests, and income.  Requires filers to file the  
            SEIs annually and at other periods of time, such as when  
            assuming or leaving office.

          4)Requires an 87200 filer who is disqualified from participating

            interest, except for members of the Legislature, to do the  
            following upon identifying the conflict of interest or  
            potential conflict of interest and immediately prior to the  
            consideration of the matter:

             a)   Publicly identify the financial interest that gives rise  
               to the conflict of interest or potential conflict of  
               interest in detail sufficient to be understood by the  
               public, except that disclosure of the exact street address

               of existing law; and,

             c)   Leave the room until after the discussion, vote, and any  
               other disposition of the matter is concluded, unless the  
               matter has been placed on the portion of the agenda  
               reserved for uncontested matters.  Provides that  
               notwithstanding this restriction, a public official who has  
               a conflict of interest may speak on the issue during the  
               time that the general public speaks on the issue.

          This bill:

          1) Increases the threshold at which a public official's  
            financial interest can potentially create a conflict of  
            interest under the PRA, as follows:



             a)   Raises the conflict of interest threshold for interests  
               in real property from $2,000 to $10,000;



             b)   Raises the conflict of interest threshold for  
               investments in a business entity from $2,000 to $5,000;  
               and,



             c)   Raises the conflict of interest threshold for sources of  
               income, other than gifts or specified loans, from $500 to  
               $1,000.



          2)Revises the monetary ranges that specified public officials or  
            candidates use to describe the value of their investments,  
            interests in real property, and income when filing a SEI.

          3)Requires a public official or candidate who is required to  
            disclose a business entity investment on his or her SEI  
            because the official or candidate is a director, officer,  
            partner, or trustee of the business entity, to provide a

            thorough and detailed description of the business entity's  
            activities and disclose the names of all business partners who  
            share a financial interest in the business entity on the SEI,  
            based on criteria established by the FPPC.  Provides, however,  
            that a filer is not required to provide a thorough and  
            detailed description of the business entity's activities and  
            is not required to disclose the names of all business partners  
            who share a financial interest in the business entity if the  
            business entity is publicly traded.



          4)Requires a public official or candidate who is required to  
            disclose his or her pro rata share of income to a business  
            entity on an SEI to include a thorough and detailed  
            description of the business activity of the business entity,  
            instead of a general description of the entity's business  
            activity.  Provides, however, that a filer is not required to  
            provide a thorough and detailed description of the business  
            activity of the business entity if the business entity is  
            publicly traded.



          5)Requires a public official who holds an office listed in  
            Section 87200 of the Government Code (a complete list of these  
            offices are detailed under "existing law" above) to disclose  
            on his or her SEI each governmental decision for which a  
            financial interest resulted in the official's disqualification  
            from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting  
            to use his or her official position to influence a  
            governmental decision.  Requires the disclosure to identify  
            the governmental decision, the date that the decision was made  
            or considered, the financial interest that created the  
            conflict of interest, and any other relevant information that  
            the FPPC determines appropriate.



          6)Makes technical and corresponding changes and contains  
            language to prevent a chaptering conflict with SB 21 (Hill).


          Background







                                                                      AB 10 <u> 
                                                                   </u> Page  7



          Statements of Economic Interests.  As part of the PRA's  
          comprehensive scheme to prevent conflicts of interest by state  
          and local public officials, existing law identifies certain  
          elected and other high-level state and local officials who must  
          file SEIs. Similarly, candidates for those positions must file  
          SEIs.  Other state and local public officials and employees are  
          required to file SEIs if the position they hold is designated in  
          an agency's conflict of interest code.  A position is designated  
          in an agency's conflict of interest code when the position  
          entails the making or participation in the making of  
          governmental decisions that may foreseeably have a material  
          financial effect on the decision maker's financial interests.   
          While the exact number of people that are required to file SEIs  
          is unknown, the FPPC has estimated that the number exceeds  
          200,000 officials and employees statewide.

          The information that must be disclosed on an SEI, and the  
          location at which an SEI is filed, varies depending on the  
          position held by the individual who is required to file an SEI.   
          Although there are some exceptions, individuals who are required  
          to file an SEI typically must file that document with the agency  
          of which they are an elected official or by which they are  
          employed.
          
          Comments
          
          1)According to the author, transparency and disclosure are  
            essential to protecting public resources, preventing  
            corruption, and restoring public trust.  This bill will  
            finally bring disclosure requirements into the 21st  
            century.  AB 10 will ensure that California's public  
            officials are more transparent in their business,  
            investment, and income disclosures, which will further  
            confirm that our trusted elected officials are using  
            their positions to serve all citizens equally.

          DIGEST:   This bill makes several significant changes to the  
          Political Reform Act (PRA) of 1974 including changes to  
          reporting requirements on statements of economic interests  
          (SEI). 
          
          ANALYSIS:   

          Existing law:

          1)Prohibits a public official from making, participating in  
            making, or in any way attempting to use his official position  
            to influence a governmental decision in which the official  
            knows or has reason to know he or she has a financial  








                                                                      AB 10 <u>

            interest, as specified.  Provides that an official has a  
            financial interest in a decision, for these purposes, if it is  
            reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material  
            financial effect, distinguishable from its effect on the  
            public generally, on the official, a member of his or her  
            immediate family, or on any of the following: 



             a)   Any business entity in which the public official has a  
               direct or indirect investment worth $2,000 or more; 



             b)   Any business entity in which the public official is a  
               director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or holds any  
               position of management; or,



             c)   Any real property in which the public official has a  
               direct or indirect interest worth $2,000 or more; 



             d)   Any source of income (except gifts or loans by a  
               commercial lending institution made in the regular course  
               of business on terms available to the public without regard  
               to official status) aggregating $500 or more in value  
               provided or promised to, received by, the public official  
               within 12 months prior to the time when the decision is  
               made; 



             e)   Any donor of, or any intermediary or agent for a donor  
               of, a gift or gifts aggregating an amount that equals or  
               exceeds the gift limit (currently $460 in a year) that is  
               provided to, received by, or promised to the public  
               official within 12 months prior to the time when the  
               decision is made.

          2)Requires candidates for, and current holders of, specified  
            elected or appointed state and local offices and designated  
            employees of state and local agencies to file SEIs disclosing  
            their financial interests, including investments, real  
            property interests, and income.  Requires filers to file the  
            SEIs annually and at other periods of time, such as when

          4)Requires an 87200 filer who is disqualified from participating

            interest, except for members of the Legislature, to do the  
            following upon identifying the conflict of interest or  
            potential conflict of interest and immediately prior to the  
            consideration of the matter:

             a)   Publicly identify the financial interest that gives rise  
               to the conflict of interest or potential conflict of  
               interest in detail sufficient to be understood by the  
               public, except that disclosure of the exact street address

             c)   Leave the room until after the discussion, vote, and any  
               other disposition of the matter is concluded, unless the  
               matter has been placed on the portion of the agenda  
               reserved for uncontested matters.  Provides that  
               notwithstanding this restriction, a public official who has  
               a conflict of interest may speak on the issue during the  
               time that the general public speaks on the issue.

          This bill:

          1) Increases the threshold at which a public official's  
            financial interest can potentially create a conflict of  
            interest under the PRA, as follows:



             a)   Raises the conflict of interest threshold for interests  
               in real property from $2,000 to $10,000;



             b)   Raises the conflict of interest threshold for  
               investments in a business entity from $2,000 to $5,000;  
               and,



             c)   Raises the conflict of interest threshold for sources of  
               income, other than gifts or specified loans, from $500 to  
               $1,000.



          2)Revises the monetary ranges that specified public officials or  
            candidates use to describe the value of their investments,  
            interests in real property, and income when filing a SEI.

          3)Requires a public official or candidate who is required to  
            disclose a business entity investment on his or her SEI  
            because the official or candidate is a director, officer,  
            partner, or trustee of the business entity, to provide a

            thorough and detailed description of the business entity's  
            activities and disclose the names of all business partners who  
            share a financial interest in the business entity on the SEI,  
            based on criteria established by the FPPC.  Provides, however,  
            that a filer is not required to provide a thorough and  
            detailed description of the business entity's activities and  
            is not required to disclose the names of all business partners  
            who share a financial interest in the business entity if the  
            business entity is publicly traded.



          4)Requires a public official or candidate who is required to  
            disclose his or her pro rata share of income to a business  
            entity on an SEI to include a thorough and detailed  
            description of the business activity of the business entity,  
            instead of a general description of the entity's business  
            activity.  Provides, however, that a filer is not required to  
            provide a thorough and detailed description of the business  
            activity of the business entity if the business entity is  
            publicly traded.



          5)Requires a public official who holds an office listed in  
            Section 87200 of the Government Code (a complete list of these  
            offices are detailed under "existing law" above) to disclose  
            on his or her SEI each governmental decision for which a  
            financial interest resulted in the official's disqualification  
            from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting  
            to use his or her official position to influence a  
            governmental decision.  Requires the disclosure to identify  
            the governmental decision, the date that the decision was made  
            or considered, the financial interest that created the  
            conflict of interest, and any other relevant information that  
            the FPPC determines appropriate.



          6)Makes technical and corresponding changes and contains  
            language to prevent a chaptering conflict with SB 21 (Hill).


          Background







                                                                      AB 10 <u> 
                                                                   </u> Page  7



          Statements of Economic Interests.  As part of the PRA's  
          comprehensive scheme to prevent conflicts of interest by state  
          and local public officials, existing law identifies certain  
          elected and other high-level state and local officials who must  
          file SEIs. Similarly, candidates for those positions must file  
          SEIs.  Other state and local public officials and employees are  
          required to file SEIs if the position they hold is designated in  
          an agency's conflict of interest code.  A position is designated  
          in an agency's conflict of interest code when the position  
          entails the making or participation in the making of  
          governmental decisions that may foreseeably have a material  
          financial effect on the decision maker's financial interests.   
          While the exact number of people that are required to file SEIs  
          is unknown, the FPPC has estimated that the number exceeds  
          200,000 officials and employees statewide.

          The information that must be disclosed on an SEI, and the  
          location at which an SEI is filed, varies depending on the  
          position held by the individual who is required to file an SEI.   
          Although there are some exceptions, individuals who are required  
          to file an SEI typically must file that document with the agency  
          of which they are an elected official or by which they are  
          employed.
          
          Comments
          
          1)According to the author, transparency and disclosure are  
            essential to protecting public resources, preventing  
            corruption, and restoring public trust.  This bill will  
            finally bring disclosure requirements into the 21st  
            century.  AB 10 will ensure that California's public  
            officials are more transparent in their business,  
            investment, and income disclosures, which will further  
            confirm that our trusted elected officials are using  
            their positions to serve all citizens equally.
