Look through the missed staff file you created

The people with last seens > than end dates occur when the OCR fucked up. These shouldn't create a huge problem

You have very few overlaps, and these can likely be corrected by simply checking for the proper house when name
matching.


ImportGiftDataRefactored:

No more fuzzy matching, just go ahead adn get all the matches you can. She'll brute force the rest

Stuff for row checking:
Ignore all uncleaned dates

Guess the assoc from the leg agency_name field


Notes for checking errors:
- If the year of the gift was 2010, you'll probably miss it
- When matching the some of the late 2015 data, your end dates are pretty much just guesses because your data
  is not current.
