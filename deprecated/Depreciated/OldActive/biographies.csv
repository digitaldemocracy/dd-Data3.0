Senator,Joel Anderson,"After four years of service in the State Assembly, Senator Joel Anderson was elected in 2010 to represent the citizens of San Diego and Riverside Counties in the thirty-sixth Senate district.  In 2014, he was re-elected to office, representing the thirty-eighth Senate district.

When first elected to the Assembly, he promised his constituents, ""I am not going to Sacramento to be a potted plant.""

True to his word, Senator Anderson authored a landmark piece of legislation in his first year of service in the Assembly.  

Assembly Bill 221 required the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System to divest from companies that violated federal law by doing business in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This legislation called for the divestment of over $24 billion of our public pensions from the Islamic Republic of Iran - the top exporter of terrorism throughout the world.

The bill sparked a national movement which led 28 other states and the United States Congress to introduce similar laws. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced to the world that he would sign AB 221 on the floor of the United Nations during his speech to the General Assembly.

AB 221 garnered national and international media coverage in over 300 articles in 13 countries. Media coverage included Time Magazine, New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Fox News' ""Your World with Neil Cavuto,"" BBC, Bloomberg, The National Review, Le Monde (France), and The Jerusalem Post (Israel).

To keep our roads safe, Senator Anderson authored legislation to make the Regional Transportation Management Center a 24/7 operation.

In recognition of the sacrifice that the men and women of our military have made in the protection of our freedoms, Senator Anderson passed AB 257 into law, which granted free state park passes to disabled veterans and recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Senator Anderson was also recognized with the 2007 ""San Diego Psychiatric Society Legislative Award"" for his ""interest in, sensitivity to, and knowledge of mental health issues."" 

Senator Anderson?s success in 2007 led national talk radio host, Roger Hedgecock, to call Joel, ""the greatest freshman Assemblyman from San Diego ever.""

In 2008, Senator Anderson joined forces with the state's sheriffs and district attorneys to curb the rampant crime of metal theft. For his dedication, these groups named Senator Anderson their Legislator of the Year.

Senator Anderson?s reach was felt on a wide array of issues; several other organizations recognized Joel for his key role as a watchdog on their cause. For his efforts to protect the Second Amendment, Senator Anderson was named the ""2008 California Rifle & Pistol Association Legislator of the Year."" He also fought hard to keep public land open for public use during his first term which earned him the ""2008 California League of Off-Road Voters Legislator of the Year Award.""

As one of their most successful alums in recent memory, Senator Anderson was awarded the ""2008 Young Republican Federation of California's Legislator of the Year Award"" for his tremendous record of success during his first term in the Legislature.

In 2009, Senator Anderson focused on fixing the state's economy and bringing jobs back to our great state. Many California businesses began leaving as the state began issuing IOUs. Joel responded by authoring AB 1506, which protects taxpayers from the state's ""forced-borrowing"" by requiring the state to accept its own IOUs for payment of state taxes and fees.

AB 1506 had 74 bi-partisan co-authors and received over 3,000 letters of support from taxpayers, labor unions, small businesses, elected officials including State Controller John Chiang.

Senator Anderson?s efforts to protect small businesses and taxpayers earned him the ""2009 Lakeside Chamber of Commerce Legislator of the Year Award"" and the ""2009 Pacific Water Quality Association's Legislator of the Year Award.""

In recognition of his efforts on behalf of veterans and their families, in 2010 the California Branch of the American Legion, named Senator Anderson as their ?Legislator of the Year.?

After being sworn in as the State Senator from California?s thirty-sixth Senate District, representing over 1,000,000 constituents, Senator Anderson affirmed his commitment to fight every day on behalf of those he represents. In 2011, for his efforts to protect small businesses during the great recession, Senator Anderson was named the ?California State Senate Legislator of the Year? by the California Small Business Association and California Small Business Roundtable.

In 2012, as Vice-Chair of the Senate Public Safety Committee, Senator Anderson continued his work to protect crime victims by authoring Senate Bill 1371, which passed both the Senate and Assembly unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Brown.  SB 1371 closed a loophole in current law that allowed convicted criminals to get out of paying restitution to the victims of their crimes.

In 2014, Senator Anderson authored SJR 17, which urged President Barack Obama?s administration to expedite visa processing for Iraq?s minority groups and to lift the refugee quota cap for Iraqi-Christians in order to streamline the process of accepting them into the United States as refugees as they are under persecution from the Sunni Islamist terrorist group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

That same year he also worked with Senator Ted Lieu (D-Los Angeles) to pass SB 828, a bill which prohibits the state from providing material support, participation or assistance to the federal government to collect electronically stored information or metadata if the if the state has actual knowledge that the request constitutes an illegal or unconstitutional collection of electronically stored information or metadata.

In 2014, Senator Anderson was re-elected to the California State Senate, representing Senate district thirty-eight.

Senator Anderson is a member of  the Senate Health Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments.  He is also a member of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee.

While Senator Anderson?s accomplishments are many, the most important role in Joel's life is that of being a husband to his wife Kate for 25 years, and a father to their three children - Mary, Maura and Michael."
Senator,Patricia C. Bates,"My name is Patricia C. Bates, but I am better known as ?Pat.? I am honored to serve as the Senator for the 36th Senate District in the California Legislature since December 1, 2014, representing nearly 1 million people from Encinitas in San Diego County to Rancho Santa Margarita in Orange County.

Elected public service was not something I sought growing up. It came gradually when I became a wife, mother, and community volunteer. My professional background is one of a Los Angeles County social worker, a position in which I helped people deal with some tough challenges in their personal lives.

What I learned as a social worker was that government must not rob people of their self-esteem and initiative. Government has an important role in protecting public safety and health, but it must act within the limits placed upon it by the people. After all, government exists to serve the people, not the other way around.

In the Senate, my focus is to solve everyday problems for Californians in a way that will preserve our quality of life, protect taxpayers, and restore fiscal common sense to government. That is what I did as the driving force behind Laguna Niguel?s campaign for cityhood and when I became its first mayor upon the city?s incorporation in 1989. I served four terms as mayor and then continued serving as a city council member until my election to the State Assembly in 1998, earning the trust of a large majority of Orange and San Diego County voters.

When I was in the Assembly, I served as Vice Chair of the Assembly Appropriations and Assembly Health committees, and was the founding Chair of the Republican Women?s Caucus to ensure that women from across the political spectrum were fully represented. While serving in the Assembly, I was appointed to the prestigious Little Hoover Commission, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed me to serve on his historic California Performance Review Commission ? responsible for providing recommendations on reforming state government and its operations.

On January 9, 2007, I was sworn-in as an Orange County Supervisor by former California Education Secretary and Senator Marian Bergeson. As only the fourth woman ever elected to the Board of Supervisors, I worked diligently to protect taxpayers and improve the county?s fiscal outlook; create business friendly policies to attract jobs; maintain high levels of public safety; shorten the timeline for delivery of transportation projects; implement pension and retiree medical liability reforms; and protect our coastal environment.

I am a proud native of Southern California, growing up in Long Beach and moving to South Orange County four decades ago. My husband John is an accomplished architect, and I am proud to have two adult children and four grandchildren."
Senator,Jim Beall,"Jim Beall brings a lifetime of experience and understanding in government efficiency, transportation, and human services to the State Senate.

In three decades of public service ? first as a San Jose City Councilman, then as a Santa Clara County Supervisor, and an Assembly member -- Jim Beall has left his mark across Silicon Valley.

He spurred the construction of Highways 85 and 87; fought to bring BART to San Jose; and authored bills to ease financing for seismic upgrades for our hospitals and also to grow California?s solar industry. This has meant thousands of good jobs for working families.

He is known throughout California for his legislation to help foster care children, low-income families, and people with disabilities.

And he has made a lasting difference in the lives of over 100,000 local youngsters by leading the drive to create the Children?s Health Initiative to ensure that every child in Santa Clara County can be covered by health insurance.

Beall plans to continue to help the people of Silicon Valley for years to come."

He continues to fight for a repeal of the fire tax, to protect both the Williamson Act, and rural public safety funding, as well as reforms that safeguard taxpayer dollars. In the Assembly, Tom was a member of the water bond working group. He continues his work on this issue in the Senate. Some of Tom?s legislative highlights include:

Senator,Kevin de Le›n,"The first Latino elected President pro Tempore of the California State Senate in more than 130 years, Senator Kevin de Le›n (D-Los Angeles) is setting a bold agenda to give every kid a fair shot at a higher education, and to combat climate change while building a new, low-carbon economy with opportunities for all Californians. Leading the Senate of the largest state in the union, Senator de Le›n takes on challenging issues that strengthen the national reach of California?s policy-making. As co-chair of Proposition 39 ? the California Clean Energy Jobs Act ? Senator de Le›n convinced voters to close a corporate tax loophole to generate billions of dollars and fund more than 40,000 California jobs that improve energy efficiency and expand clean energy generation in schools. This year, Senator de Le›n?s Democratic caucus has introduced legislation to strengthen California?s climate leadership by pursuing standards that will reduce petroleum use by 50 percent, set a 50 percent renewable energy standard for the state?s utilities and increase building energy efficiency by 50 percent, all by 2030. Senator de Le›n also has introduced a bill to require the state?s public employee pension funds to divest from coal and, by 2050, increase the state?s overall climate pollution reduction target to 80 percent below 1990 levels. Senator de Le›n was elected to the State Assembly in 2006 and elected to the State Senate in 2010. In 2012, Senator de Le›n authored Senate Bill 1234 ?Secure Choice Act? which created a first-in-the-nation retirement savings program for over 6.3 million workers in California?s private sector. The New York Times called his efforts to provide retirement security to millions of low-income workers ?a model for addressing a national problem.? Other legislative accomplishments include trailblazing authorship of the 'Yes Means Yes' bill to protect college students against violence and sexual abuse; Assembly Bill 31 which allocated local park assistance funds to communities lacking parks and green space, resulting in 126 park projects across the state; Workers? Compensation reform that lowered insurance costs for businesses, while increasing workers? benefits; and lead negotiator for the expansion of California?s Film and Television Tax Credit to keep Hollywood?s production jobs at home in the Golden State. Long before being arriving at the Legislature, de Le›n dedicated himself to public service and served immigrant communities through teaching U.S. citizenship courses. The work led him to community organizing and taking a stand against 1994?s Proposition 187, a voter-approved statewide initiative that denied government services to undocumented immigrants. In response, Senator de Le›n organized the largest civil rights march in California history. Twenty years later, Senator de Le›n continues to fight for immigrants? rights. He authored Senate Bill 396 erased the language of Prop 187 from California law in addition to first-in-the-nation legislation to prevent the unnecessary separation of families, protecting them from legal complications due to differences in immigration status. In 2013, he brokered a compromise with Governor Jerry Brown to ensure signage of Assembly Bill 60, a law which allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses so they could drive to work, maintain insurance and step out of the shadow economy. De Leon credits his immigrant mother for teaching him the nobility of a hard day?s work and our shared obligation to build a brighter future for the next generation. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, later earning a degree with Honors from Pitzer College. He is a Rodel Fellow at the Aspen Institute and a guest lecturer at the University of Southern California. His daughter is a student in college. - See more at: http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/biography#sthash.izhPgvFL.dpuf"

Senator,Loni Hancock,"Loni Hancock has spent nearly four decades as a forceful advocate for open government, educational reform, environmental protection, economic development, and social justice.  Prior to her election to the California State Senate in 2008, she served three terms in the California State Assembly (14th District). She also was the first woman elected mayor of the City of Berkeley (1986-1994), the Executive Director of the Shalan Foundation, and served in both the Carter and Clinton Administrations.

Senator Hancock currently represents the 9th State Senate District, which includes the cities of Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Emeryville, El Sobrante, Hercules, Kensington, Oakland, Piedmont, Pinole, Richmond, Rodeo, San Leandro and San Pablo. 

Born and raised in New York, Loni Hancock received her BA from Ithaca College in 1963 and her MA from the Wright Institute in 1978.  She moved to Berkeley in 1964, where she lives today with her husband, Mayor Tom Bates.  Senator Hancock has four children and seven grandchildren.

Criminal Justice

Senator Hancock has been a leading advocate for  investing state resources in rehabilitation programs, job training, and employment because she understands that these and similar programs reduce inmate recidivism. As Chair of the Senate Public Safety Committee and the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Subcommittee #5 on Corrections and Public Safety, Senator Hancock seeks to examine programs at all levels of the criminal justice system and implement sound policies that reduce prison overcrowding while protecting public safety.

Senator Hancock believes that California?s corrections system is an expensive failure and requires a fundamental restructuring. As a start, Senator Hancock is working to bring government closer to the people by allowing local governments to carry out vital law enforcement services in a more effective and efficient manner.

Senator Hancock has introduced legislation to provide case management and evidence-based programming to inmates in their last year of incarceration, and bring transparency and accountability to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the Office of the Inspector General. Previously, she has introduced legislation to improve education programs in state prison and require the CDCR to provide inmates with a CA identification card upon release of incarceration.

Government Reform

Since entering the California State Legislature, Senator Hancock has vigorously championed government reform.  In 2009-10, she chaired the Elections, Reapportionment and Constitutional Amendments Committee. She introduced two major Senate Constitutional Amendments aimed at reducing gridlock and increasing the effectiveness of the California State Legislature: SCA 5 would have replaced the 2/3 vote formerly required to pass a budget with a simple majority vote and SCA 24 would change California?s term limits requirement so experienced legislators are available to solve the difficult problems facing California.

As an Assemblymember, Senator Hancock authored AB 583 ? the California Clean Money and Fair Elections Act ? which sought to reform campaign financing by providing full public financing for statewide elections.  AB 583 establishes a pilot project to make public financing available to candidates for Secretary of State so they can wage competitive campaigns without soliciting money from special interests.

Environment

Senator Hancock has sustained a strong commitment to environmental protection throughout her career.  As a member of the Berkeley City Council, she successfully worked to preserve the Berkeley Marina from development and protect local wildlife.

While in the Assembly, Senator Hancock served as Chair of the Committee on Natural Resources.   In this role, she led efforts to pass historic environmental legislation that would protect open space, expand recycling, and promote healthy city-infill strategies.

Senator Hancock currently serves on the Environmental Quality Committee, which oversees legislation relating to air and water quality, waste management and toxic substances, among other environmental issues.

Education

Senator Hancock has devoted much of her career to developing public policies that support and improve public schools in the East Bay and throughout California.

As head of the Western Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Education during the Clinton Administration, Hancock launched after-school, early reading preparation, college preparedness, and other initiatives. She helped schools in California receive millions of dollars in federal education funding.

As a member of the Assembly and Senate Committees on Education, Senator Hancock fought against tuition increases, elimination of outreach programs, and deep cuts to community college, CSU and UC budgets.

Senator Hancock has authored legislation that greatly expands school-to-career education for California?s high school students.  She strongly believes in career academies because they keep young people in school, and better prepares them for college and for real jobs in the new economy.  Senator Hancock currently chairs the Select Committee on Workforce Development, School Environment, and Student Wellness.

Senator,"Dr. Ed Hernandez, O.D.","Dr. Ed Hernandez had only one goal as a young man ? to serve the health care needs of the community he came from.  As an optometrist and local businessman, he never dreamed he would one day work in the California State Legislature.  As a health care provider in predominantly low-income communities though, the need to improve access to health care is what drove him to run for office.  Dr. Ed was first elected to the Assembly in November of 2006, and re-elected in November of 2008.  He won his seat in the California State Senate in November of 2010 and was re-elected once again in 2014.

Senator Hernandez serves as Chair for the Senate Committee on Health.  He is also a member of the Business, Professions, and Economic Development Committee, the Government and Finance Committee,  the Committee for Governmental Organization, and the Senate Insurance Committee.

Senator Hernandez is the Chair of the San Gabriel Valley Legislative Caucus, made up of 12 Senators and Assemblymembers representing the greater San Gabriel Valley.  This position has allowed him to work in cooperation with fellow legislators on issues critical to the San Gabriel Valley, including water and transportation.

Senator Hernandez grew up in La Puente, attended local schools and graduated from Bassett High School.  He worked his way through school, attending both Rio Hondo and Mt. San Antonio Community Colleges before going on to get his B.S. degree in Biology from Cal State Fullerton.  He received a scholarship to study Optometry at Indiana University, which is also where he met his wife Diane.  After returning home, Dr. Ed and his wife setup their first practice in his hometown of La Puente.

Senator Hernandez proudly represents the 22nd Senate District, which encompasses the cities and communities of the San Gabriel Valley, which include: Alhambra, Monterey Park, San Gabriel, South San Gabriel, Rosemead, El Monte, South El Monte, Baldwin Park, Irwindale, Industry, Avocado Heights, La Puente, Valinda, West Covina, Vincent, Azusa, Citrus, Covina, Temple City, Arcadia and surrounding neighborhoods."
Senator,Bob Hertzberg,"Hi. I?m Bob Hertzberg. It is my honor and privilege to serve the nearly 1 million residents of the San Fernando Valley in the California Senate, for which I was elected in November, 2014.

As many of you know, this is not my first stint as a statewide policy maker. I was first elected to the California Assembly in 1996. After three years of hard work, I was twice unanimously elected Speaker and served until 2002. Then I spent a dozen years building a successful career in private industry and helping to establish groundbreaking public policy in several areas. I?ve always fought for BIG and BOLD ideas to fix California and tried to always think long term and solve tough problems.

As Speaker, for example, I helped preserve the quality of our air and water. I fought to stop the abuse of the elderly and to protect consumers from credit card companies and big banks. I supported expansion of the Cal-Grants program, giving more poor students unprecedented access to California?s colleges and universities. And I responded to public safety concerns by leading the way on opening new criminal investigation laboratories. By focusing on the future, such as our education infrastructure, our next generation of leaders can only be better prepared to make public policy.

Among other accomplishments, on a range of issues challenging California:

Helped negotiate more than $35 billion in school construction bonds ? the largest municipal bond issue in U.S. history.
Hammered out a settlement on prudent water policies that advanced landmark agriculture-to-urban water transfers and provided a framework to end nearly seven decades of California/Colorado River water disputes.
Fought for establishment of a 10th UC campus in Merced to educate under-served students in an underserved region.
Also, while in the Assembly, and in response to term limits, I led development of a comprehensive program to train newly elected members. Called the Capitol Institute, the education program taught newly elected members how the Capitol works and the mechanics of how ideas became laws. Training sessions by veteran legislators and staff, videos and a set of binders became resources for new and old members alike. The Capitol Institute eventually expanded into a staff training program still offered today

Staying active

After leaving government service in 2002, I continued to be active, as a global clean-energy entrepreneur, as a lawyer and as a leader on government reform. Even though I left public office, I never stopped devoting time and energy toward solving California?s toughest problems.

The result ? today I am better qualified to serve California and am more knowledgeable of our problems than before. Working outside government for more than a decade provided invaluable insights into how our great state can better compete globally. I better understand the nuances of creating economic change.

Many of these insights came from working around the globe ? traveling throughout China and to numerous countries in Africa. In recognition of these efforts, I received the World Bank Award for Lighting Africa for a project in Rwanda. Also, UK Guardian, Europe?s leading newspaper, named me one of the ?50 people who could save the planet.?

I broadened my business background when I co-founded Solar Integrated Technologies, the first solar company in Los Angeles. I then co-founded Renewable Capital ? a first-of-its-kind green venture capital company. Through Renewable Capital, I co-founded G24 Innovations, a company that produced lightweight and inexpensive solar panels.

Background

As a native of Los Angeles, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Redlands with bachelor?s degrees in History and English. Three years later, I received my Juris Doctor from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and have been an active member of the State Bar since 1979. I have two grown sons. David is a classical music composer and a Juilliard Graduate, and Daniel graduated Goucher College and, like me (poor guy), loves politics and public policy."
