Title,Name,Biography
Assembly Member,Katcho Achadjian,"Katcho Achadjian was sworn in for his third term on December 1, 2014 to represent the 35th Assembly District in the California Legislature, which includes the communities of Arroyo Grande, Atascadero, Grover Beach, Guadalupe, Lompoc, Morro Bay, Paso Robles, Pismo Beach, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Maria.
 
In 1971, Katcho came to California to complete his education and pursue the American Dream. He carried with him a distinctive work ethic instilled in him by his Armenian parents in Lebanon - an ethic that has served him well in his roles as businessman, community volunteer and legislator. On December 17, 1982, a day that serves as a continuous source of pride for him, Katcho became a United States Citizen.
 
Katcho attended Cuesta Community College and graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in Business Administration. He and his wife Araxie were married in 1984 and they have a son, Hratch, and daughter, Nyri.
 
A lifelong community volunteer, Katcho has volunteered in support of numerous civic, service, and nonprofit organizations. He has served as a Member of the Board of Directors of Arroyo Grande Community Hospital and Chairman of San Luis Obispo's French Hospital. Since 2008, he has also served as a mentor to college students through the Executive Partners Leadership Council at Cal Poly's Orfalea College of Business.
 
The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Katcho was named a Cuesta College Distinguished Alumnus in 2007 and he was given the Distinguished Alumni Award from the Community College League of California in 2008. He was also recognized as Arroyo Grande Citizen of the Year in 1984.
 
Katcho knows first-hand how difficult the Legislature has made it to create and retain jobs in California. He founded a successful local small business in 1978, and has built it up to employ some 30 workers at three locations. In the Assembly, he is fighting to reduce the burdens of mandates, regulations and taxes that are driving businesses and jobs away.
 
Prior to his election to the Legislature, Katcho served for three terms as an elected member of the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors. Katcho served as Board Chairman in 2001 and again in 2006. As a member of the Board of Supervisors, he helped craft and secure passage of balanced and on-time budgets for 12 straight years and built up county reserves. He fought hard to protect taxpayers, property rights, and public safety while holding down the cost of government.
 
Throughout his career, Katcho has been a strong champion of protecting the region's abundant natural resources and pristine coastline. In 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed him to serve as a member of the California Coastal Commission, charged with protecting the beauty of California's coastline. He served as a member of the commission until his election to the Assembly in 2010.
 
Working hard to give our children the strong foundation they need to lead strong, healthy lives, Katcho was the founding chairman in 1999 of the San Luis Obispo County First 5 Commission. The Commission allocates funds and advocates for quality programs and services that support children prenatal to age 5 and ensure that every child is healthy and ready to learn in school.
 
In both his private and public service, Katcho has been a strong supporter of public safety. He has served as a Charter Board member of the San Luis Obispo Law Enforcement Assistance Foundation (SLO LEAF) since 2002, serving as Secretary in 2002 and Vice President from 2004 to 2010. He has been a member of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Advisory Council since 1989 serving as its Chairman from 1994 to1995. Katcho was recognized with the CA Attorney General's Certificate of Appreciation for Support of Law Enforcement in September 2004.
 
A passionate advocate for farmers and ranchers throughout the Central Coast region, Governor Pete Wilson recognized Katcho's grasp of the county's agricultural issues by appointing him to the San Luis Obispo County Fair Board. He served from 1992-99, and as Board Chair in 1995.
 
Reforming government to make it more efficient and accountable to taxpayers, cutting wasteful spending and programs, and making California's economy more competitive for job creation are some of Assemblyman Achadjian's top legislative priorities.
 
Fighting hard for the Central Coast's working families, Assemblyman Achadjian currently serves as Chair of the Assembly Local Government Committee, and as a member of the Assembly Committees on Accountability and Administrative Review, Banking and Finance, Transportation, and Joint Legislative Audit"
Assembly Member,Luis A. Alejo,"Luis A. Alejo was raised in Watsonville, a small agricultural town in the heart of California?s Central Valley.  Growing up with two parents working in the agriculture industry during the 1950s, Alejo was fortunate to witness the power of political activism at an early age.   Cesar Chavez led the fight to gain workers? rights for thousands of farm laborers the Central Valley, and had a major impact in a generation of social movements.  From an auspicious beginning, Alejo developed a sense of personal commitment to helping his community.  In 2013, as California State Assemblymember for the 30th District, Alejo proved his commitment by authoring landmark legislation on behalf of the disadvantaged and underrepresented throughout California.

Like many Americans, Alejo found early opportunities through education.  After watching his parents use education as a stepping stone to a better life, Alejo understood the value of academic success.  Alejo?s father, a Vietnam War era veteran, used the G.I. bill to pursue vocational training and later his teaching credential at San Jose State; his mother becoming a nurse once finishing school.  After attending Watsonville High School and Gavilan Community College, Alejo transferred to the University of California at Berkeley.

At UC Berkeley, one of the nation?s top universities, Alejo graduated with honors, receiving dual bachelor?s degrees in political science and Chicano studies.  After returning home to teach special need students and at-risk youth, Alejo continued his education at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctorate (JD).  While at UC Davis, Alejo was honored with the prestigious Martin Luther King Community Service Award, the Maggie Schelen Public Service Award, and the Lorenzo Pati?o Community Service Award.  As a result of his exceptional work, Alejo was accepted to Harvard University, finishing his academic career by obtaining his masters of education degree (Ed.M) in administration, planning and social policy.

After finishing his graduate and professional studies, Alejo began his legal career, championing the rights of working families as a staff attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation and the Monterey County Superior Court. Representing thousands of individuals who couldn?t afford private attorneys, Alejo helped disadvantaged families face a myriad of legal problems.  Encouraged by the opportunity to help others, Alejo eventually decided to take a chance at public office.

Alejo got his first taste of politics as a Jesse M. Unruh Fellow for the California State Assembly at the State Capital in Sacramento.  During the 2002 legislative session, he drafted and staffed numerous bills and resolutions, and earned a reputation for being an effective and hardworking legislative staffer; knowledge of which he would bring to his first-term in the Assembly.  Before being elected to the Assembly, Alejo served as the Mayor of Watsonville, as well as on the Watsonville Planning Commission, the Library Board, and the Santa Cruz County Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Commission.

Alejo was first elected to the Assembly in November 2010 to represent the 28th Assembly District, which consisted of San Benito County, the Salinas Valley, North Monterey County, South Santa Clara County and the city of Watsonville. In November of 2012, he was re-elected to the Assembly as the representative of the newly formed 30th Assembly District. Alejo?s new district now contains a greater portion of the Monterey County coast and south Santa Clara County.

Currently, Assemblymember Alejo sits on four standing committees. Most notably, Alejo is the Chair of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials. Other committee assignments include Judiciary, Labor and Employment, and Local Government.  During his first term in the State Assembly, Alejo focused on bringing jobs back to California as well as authoring legislation in the areas of education, healthcare, public safety, civil rights and public access to government. In his second term, Alejo built on his success by authoring, among others, two historic pieces of legislation in 2013.

Assembly Bill (AB) 60 ? The Safe and Responsible Driver Act ? gives undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply for a driver?s licenses.  Once implemented, AB 60 will improve public safety by ensuring all drivers can be licensed and insured.  Equally as important, AB 60 gives millions of Californians the peace of mind to make the necessary travels in order to work and support their families without fear of unnecessary consequences.  In addition, Alejo managed to get AB 10 signed into law, raising the minimum wage in California to $10 an hour, the highest in the nation.  Income inequality has always been a pressing issue for Alejo, whose first bill as an Assemblymember proposed raising the minimum wage.  AB 10 was the culmination of three years? work and helps ensure equality and respect for our state?s minimum wage workers. 

Alejo previously made national headlines in May 2012 when he became the first Assemblymember to propose in the Assembly Chambers during legislative session. He and his wife, Karina Cervantez Alejo, married on December 8, 2012. Karina, who was previously elected as a Councilmember, now serves as the Mayor for the City of Watsonville.  Luis and Karina Alejo live in Watsonville with their two dogs, Diego and Frida."

As a Financial Planner, Assemblyman Allen saw the damage done to the portfolios of his hard working clients by government overregulation and bad policies.

Assembly Member,Frank Bigelow,"The first thing you?ll notice about rancher Frank Bigelow is his hat. To Frank?s way of thinking, he wears it as a symbol of respect for the sacrifice of those who settled our region and it serves as a commitment to continue to preserve our way of life.
 
With family roots that date to the late 1800?s, Frank?s great grandparents, Harmon and Leota Bigelow, settled in the O?Neals area of Madera County and established a cattle and sheep ranch along with a wagon and stage line that served the high country of the Sierra Nevada.
 
Later, Harmon strung two wires through the trees so that his wife could talk to her friend a half-mile away with a telephone. In 1908, after requests for service from other settlers and a subsequent request by the Forest Service to take over its phone lines, the Bigelow Telephone Company became Ponderosa Telephone Company.
 
An employee of the Ponderosa Telephone Company since 1973, Frank worked his way up through the ranks of the company, learning all facets of the business and currently serves as Vice President. Frank remains active in the operation of his family?s cattle ranch Bigelow Farms.
 
One of the realities of our region is the threat of fire. Although an official firefighter on his 18th birthday, Frank?s commitment to fire safety was born on the ranch as a young boy. 39 years later, Frank continues serve as a volunteer with his local fire department.
 
Frank resides in O?Neals, with his wife of 35 years, Barbara. First elected to the State Assembly in 2012, Bigelow is committed to protecting rural California and our rural way of life."

She is chair of the Assembly Business, Professions, and Consumer Protection Committee, and sits on the Assembly Health Committee and the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee. She also chairs the Assembly Select Committee on Increasing the Integration of STEM Education in California K-14 Schools.

In 2014, Assemblywoman Bonilla authored the groundbreaking business innovation and consumer protection bill, AB 2293, which clarifies insurance coverage for Transportation Network Companies such as Uber and Lyft. This bill ensures that drivers, passengers and pedestrians are protected, while supporting the innovative ride-sharing business model. During last year?s legislative session, she also authored two significant public safety measures: AB 1147, the Massage Therapy Reform Act, which returns local land-use authority to cities and counties to eliminate human trafficking and prostitution from the massage industry, and AB 2560, which addresses the recent number of child abuse cases in schools by ensuring all credentialed school employees understand their responsibilities to report all child abuse cases to local law enforcement. In addition, she co-authored AB 1432, which complements AB 2560 by requiring annual training on mandated reporting and identifying child abuse and neglect for all certified school employees.

This past year, Assemblywoman Bonilla made it a priority to address a number of public policy issues, including the state?s current physician shortage and discrimination against members of the LGBT community. AB 1838 allows more graduates of accelerated and fully accredited medical programs to become licensed physicians in California, and AB 2501 prohibits the use of the ?panic defense,? where defendants claim that a state of panic provoked their malicious act, in an attempt to lower or escape charges. Furthermore, as a leader for women?s rights, Assemblywoman Bonilla helped keep women in the Science, Technology, Education, and Math (STEM) fields. AB 2350 requires universities to adopt policies to implement Title IX and protect the rights of pregnant graduate students, by ensuring that they receive the appropriate and necessary accommodations to complete their programs.

Assembly Member,Rob Bonta,"Assemblymember Rob Bonta was elected to the California State Assembly's 18th District in 2012, where he represents the cities of Oakland, Alameda, and San Leandro as the first Filipino American state legislator in the history of California.

Rob?s passion for justice and equality was instilled in him at a very young age by his parents, who taught him to understand injustice and the importance of joining the struggle to empower vulnerable communities. His father was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, and stood with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Deep South ? marching for equality and justice in Selma. His mother was and continues to be a long-time leader in the Filipino social justice movement.

Growing up in a trailer just a few hundred yards from C?sar Chÿvez?s home, Bonta watched closely as his parents organized Filipino and Mexican American farm workers, infusing his formative years with first-hand experience of one of the greatest peaceful social, racial, and economic justice movements of all time. This had a huge impact on Rob?s life choices and pursuits, inspiring his life?s commitment to helping people.

Rob believed legal training was one of the most powerful ways to effect positive and profound change in the lives of those who needed it most. He worked his way through college cleaning laundry rooms and, with the help of financial aid, was able to achieve his dream of attending some of the best universities in the world, obtaining his Juris Doctorate from Yale Law School after attending Yale College and Oxford University in England.  Earning honors in college, Rob was also a scholar athlete, captaining the Yale Soccer team. He also paved the way for the advancement of students of color as a mentor and volunteered in support of local children struggling with poverty.

His legal career included work as a Deputy City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco, where he represented the City and County and its employees, and as a private attorney, where he fought to protect Californians from exploitation and racial profiling.  Rob was undefeated at trial, never losing a jury verdict for his clients. Prior to being elected to the Alameda City Council, Rob served as the Chair of the City of Alameda?s Economic Development Commission, where he focused on business attraction and retention efforts, and as board president for the Social Service Human Relations Board, where he fought to protect safety net services for the most vulnerable members of the community. As Vice Mayor of the City of Alameda, Bonta strongly supported public safety, fostered economic development, and exercised fiscal responsibility. 

In the Assembly, Bonta continues to build upon this work, successfully passing  legislation to keep neighborhoods safe, provide a quality education to all of our children, build prosperous and healthy communities, foster economic opportunity, and protect our social service safety net. In 2014, Bonta passed 20 bills through the Legislature, 16 of which were signed into law by Governor Brown (2 of those were signed as part of the Budget Act).

Bonta?s work to improve the health of Californians began as an elected member of the Alameda Health Care District Board of Directors, where he championed access to quality health care for all ? a goal he further pursued his first two years in the Assembly as a member of the Health Committee. He has also authored and co-authored a number of bills to promote public health, including AB 174 to provide funding for school-based health centers, AB 514 and AB 1629 to increase access to services for victims of gun violence, AB 1271 to require school safety plans to include a mental health plan for students, AB 966 to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STDs in prisons, and SB 1005 to expand health care benefits to undocumented members of our community.  Appointed Chair of the Assembly Health Committee by Speaker Toni Atkins in December 2014, Bonta continues to build upon this strong track record of promoting a healthier California by authoring AB 72 with Speaker Atkins, to ensure California continues to provide the best possible health care services to its residents.

As Chair of the Select Committee on Gun Violence in the East Bay during his first two years in the Assembly, Bonta held hearings throughout the state to engage stakeholders and identify strategies to reduce gun violence in his own district and throughout California. The hearings inspired Bonta to introduce AB 1629 to expand the California Victims Compensation Program to include reimbursement for violence prevention and intervention services to help heal victims, families, and communities harmed by violent crime. The bill passed the Legislature with strong bipartisan support and was signed by the Governor.

As Chair of the Public Employees, Retirement, and Social Security Committee, Bonta convened a series of hearings to address the $74 billion CalSTRS funding shortfall, which resulted in AB 1469, a legislative fix to address the long-term CalSTRS shortfall and ensure that hard-working teachers receive the retirement security they have been promised.

Bonta paid tribute to his parents? work and the Filipino-American community by authoring AB 123 his first year in the Assembly. AB 123 requires state school curricula to include the contributions of Filipinos to the farm labor movement in California. Governor Brown fittingly signed the bill during Filipino Heritage Month. Now, a new generation of Californians will learn about the transformative struggle for justice of the farm labor movement and the great historical collaboration between Filipino Americans and Latinos, which is so much a part of Bonta?s own family history.

Bonta currently serves as Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, the Public Employees, Retirement, and Social Security Committee, and the Co-Chair of the Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in California. He is also a member of the following committees: Appropriations, Budget, Budget Subcommittee No. 1 on Health and Human Services, Joint Legislative Budget, and Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management."

The organization has served as a statewide initiative to better inform, educate, and advocate for the African American community, as well as help promote minority-owned news organizations.

Achievements from First Term in the State Assembly (2012-2014)

Modernizing and Investing in our Roads and Highways 

Daly led the successful passage of a bill that enables an innovative, cost-savings approach to freeway improvement projects statewide.  The Orange County Transportation Authority says this new law will save Orange County taxpayers approximately $100 million and speed up the project completion date by two to three years on the 405 freeway improvement project.  For this effort, Daly was honored as ?Legislator of the Year? by the California Transportation Foundation and Mobility 21 (Southern California transportation group)

Reducing Bureaucratic Red-Tape

Daly championed an effort to reduce processing delays for business filings in the Secretary of State?s Office.  The Legislature found that basic paperwork for starting a business was taking 6-8 weeks to be processed. That?s unacceptable, especially when it only takes Texas and New York 5 days.  Under Daly?s leadership, the Legislature acted quickly and insisted on a reasonable five-day turn-around. The processing time is now down to five days.

Supporting our Veterans

Daly was a principal co-author of the bill signed by Governor Brown to create an Orange County Veterans Cemetery.

Washington, Atwater Village, and Silver Lake.

Gomez was born and raised in Southern California and is the youngest of six children. His parents and four of his siblings immigrated to California from Mexico in the early 1970s. They brought with them a strong sense of family and a strong work ethic. To make ends meet, his mother and father often worked multiple jobs.

After graduating from high school, Jimmy found work where he could ? at a fast-food restaurant and a local superstore. But instead of working a 9am to 5pm schedule, he worked from 5pm to 9am the next day. After several months of working both jobs, and with the memory of his parents? struggle to make ends meet...something just clicked! He now clearly understood the need of a good job with benefits, and most importantly a quality education.

With this newfound clarity, Jimmy enrolled in community college and ultimately transferred to UCLA, where he graduated magna cum laude and received a BA in Political Science with a minor in urban planning. Ten years after graduating from high school, he earned a Master?s in Public Policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.  

Gomez recognizes that his story today, although not unique, is a lot harder to achieve and out of reach for far too many people because of the struggling economy and the state budget deficit. He believes this is unacceptable and our families deserve better.

To help rebuild California, Gomez will fight to increase access to quality education and good jobs by providing leadership based on working class values, pragmatic problem solving skills and a dedication to the empowerment of individuals and communities.

As a Director for the United Nurses Associations of California, Gomez empowered nurses to better advocate for their patients through the legislative process and community service.

He has challenged special favors for public sector labor unions, and his robust defense of the Constitution and the Second Amendment has garnered state-wide attention.

This catchphrase turned into a weekly video segment, which has since garnered statewide media attention and speaking engagements.    
 
His articulate commentary and leadership abilities earned him the appointment as Chairman of the Assembly Republican Caucus in 2012.

Brian?s deep convictions in free market principles, the need for government reform and tax relief comes from his service in both the public and private sector.  His background as a businessman and his service as Councilmember and Vice Mayor of Santee strengthened his resolve to restore decision making to the local level and to insure that tax monies meet community needs.
 
Brian has been a Santee resident since 1978; he attended Santee Elementary, Cajon Park Jr. High, and Santana High School.  After graduating, Brian attended San Diego State University where he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration.

Adrin developed his passion for public service from an early age and while in college decided to volunteer in as many places he could to better understand in what arena he would apply himself. A life altering experience was when he applied to become an interviewer of battered and abused women at the San Fernando Valley Superior Court Domestic Violence Clinic unit as a summer internship job. There he saw first-hand the results of what happens in the privacy of homes, taking down reports in order to submit restraining orders on behalf of the victims. This experience stayed with Adrin, which years later lead him to sit on the YWCA Board, and has influenced each of his policy making roles in public service.

Upon graduating UCLA, Adrin participated in the prestigious CORO Fellowship in Public Affairs program. From 1997-1999, Adrin served as an aide to Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), assisting him with business and labor community issues.

Assembly Member,Kristin Olsen,"Assembly Republican Leader Kristin Olsen was first elected to the California State Assembly in November 2010 and overwhelmingly re-elected to her third term in November 2014. She represents the 12th Assembly District, which encompasses parts of San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties in California?s Central Valley.  She is the first mother of school-aged children to serve as Leader of a Republican or Democratic caucus in the California Legislature.

A decisive leader who can bring people together, Olsen was named Chief Republican Whip in her first term. She served as Vice Chair of both the Assembly Agriculture and Education committees, and has also served on the Insurance, Higher Education and Accountability and Administrative Review Committees. She was named Legislator of the Year in 2012 by the Regional Council of Rural Counties, in recognition of her hard work and legislative achievements on behalf of her constituents and rural residents throughout the State.

Olsen is a committed and respected leader with a reputation for reform, problem-solving, and hard work. She was selected by the State Legislative Leaders Foundation for its prestigious 2012 Emerging Leaders Program which brought together rising leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, from all over the United States to participate in conference at the University of Virginia.

Born, raised and now raising her own family in Modesto, Olsen has a passion for the communities, businesses, and people of California?s Central Valley communities. She previously served on the Modesto City Council from 2005 to 2009, where she stood up for fiscal responsibility, public safety, and economic development.

During her time in the State Assembly, she has successfully passed reforms to environmental, education, and veterans policies in order to protect and grow jobs and facilitate educational excellence.  She also has been a leader on introducing reforms to enhance government accountability and transparency, and has led by example as the first legislator to release her office budget to the public.

In support of working families and small businesses, Olsen has introduced and co-authored bills that would update California?s antiquated labor code to allow working parents and all employees more flexible scheduling options.

A vocal advocate for youth and education, Olsen has partnered with colleagues to get important education reform measures passed. AB 215, which will become effective January 1, 2015, will expedite the dismissal process for teachers who have participated in egregious misconduct such as abuse, sexual abuse and drug crimes, and also improves a school?s ability to remove ineffective teachers. In 2013, Olsen was instrumental in garnering support for the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), a groundbreaking budget reform policy that allows schools to determine the best use of funds for their unique districts.

Olsen has led the charge against onerous and broken environmental policies that have prevented important projects from moving forward. She successfully passed a bill that reformed the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to allow cities and counties to make minor roadway safety improvements, and a bill that eliminated unnecessary bureaucratic roadblocks to restoration construction of State Route 140, which leads directly into Yosemite National Park.

A staunch supporter of veterans and active duty military members, last year the Governor signed two of Olsen?s bills dedicated to serving the needs of those who have made sacrifices to protect our country.  AB 150 authorized the Department of Parks and Recreation to provide veterans with free admission to California?s state parks on Memorial Day and Veteran?s Day.

AB 151 allows counties the option of waiving building and inspection permit fees for ADA-type modifications to homes owned by veterans with service-related disabilities. Before the passage of this bill, counties were required to collect fees for home modifications, improvements and inspections ? a process that was at times drawn out and expensive.

After graduating Magna Cum Laude from Westmont College in 1996 with a Bachelor?s in Communications Studies, Olsen was selected to participate in the prestigious Senate Fellowship Program, where she developed a passion for public service.  While serving on the Modesto City Council, she also worked as the Assistant Vice President for Communications & Public Affairs at California State University, Stanislaus where she directed the University?s marketing and communications programs.

Olsen now serves on the Board for CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates), an organization promoting volunteer advocacy for abused and neglected children, and on the Board for California Women Lead, an organization committed to encouraging and training women to be leaders in their communities.

Olsen and her husband, Rod, live in Modesto with their three children."
Assembly Member,Jim Patterson,"Jim Patterson represents the 23rd Assembly District in the California State Assembly and is honored to serve portions of Fresno and Tulare counties, including the communities of Auberry, Centerville, Clovis, Fresno, Friant, Minkler, Shaver Lake and Three Rivers. Elected to the Assembly in 2012, he is currently serving his second term.
 
Jim and wife Sharon have lived in Fresno for most of their lives, raising three children, and now three grandchildren in the Central Valley.
 
He spent most of his professional career as a businessman and broadcast executive owning and operating radio stations in California and Idaho.
 
Serving two terms as the Mayor of Fresno from 1993-2001, he inherited the leadership of a city in free-fall with exploding crime levels and out of control auto thefts. After eight years of focused leadership, Jim left the City of Fresno with a $20 million general fund surplus, a AAA credit rating, over a billion dollars of new business approvals that created thousands of new jobs, and a reborn reputation for achievement that the National Civic League recognized when it designated Fresno an All-America City in 2000. Fresno residents saw crime plunge to a 25-year low. Homicides dropped to less than 25 a year and car thefts were down nearly 75 percent.
 
Jim currently serves as Vice-Chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee. He has introduced legislation focusing on improving the business climate in California and is dedicated to streamlining the often frustrating vocational licensing process. In 2013 Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 1028, which fast-tracks licenses for vocational nurses by removing government red-tape.
 
Making sure the ballots of our military men and women serving overseas are counted is also important to Jim. He fought hard for legislation to give those ballots three extra days to make it to California to be counted.
 
Jim is the Co-Chair of the Aviation Caucus. He earned his private pilot's license in 1968 and has logged nearly 2,500 hours of flight time. He has flown a range of airplanes including the Cessna 210, the Twin Bonanza B50, and the Citabria aerobatic 7GCAA. Because he has experienced the enjoyment of flying first-hand, he is using his role on the Aviation Caucus to remind policy-makers and the general public of the many ways General Aviation has contributed to California's economic and recreational well-being.
 
Having adopted three children, Jim and his family are passionate advocates for adoption. He is determined to promote adoption during his service in the Legislature and has authored several laws that streamline the process, making it quicker and easier for parents seeking to adopt."

During his first term in the Legislature, Perea chaired the Assembly Committee on Revenue and Taxation. There, he worked to bring a balanced approach to California?s tax policy. One of his accomplishments as Chair was getting Assembly Bill (AB) 36 signed into law; AB 36 provides tax relief to parents who keep their adult children on their family health plan.

During his second term Perea chaired the Assembly Committee on Insurance. As Chair, Perea got AB 1309 signed into law; AB 1309 closed a loophole in California?s Workers' Compensation system.  Additionally, amidst crisis with the Employment Development Department?s Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, Perea held legislative hearings, worked with the administration, and authored legislation to ensure claimants had access to their benefits. These efforts led to changes in the UI program that dramatically improved service. 

Some of Perea's other legislative accomplishments are within the areas of health care, energy, air quality, alternative fuels, and clean drinking water. In 2013, Perea successfully authored AB 327, California's first comprehensive electric rate reform bill since the 2001 energy crisis. He also successfully authored AB 219, a bill that lowers the out-of-pocket costs for cancer patients utilizing oral chemo therapy.

In addition, Perea was one of the lead authors of the water bond, and fought to bring funding for water infrastructure and good paying jobs to the Central Valley. The Association of California Water Agencies and the Latino Water Coalition both honored Perea for his leadership in securing passage of the water bond.

During his first term, Perea fought to save Fresno?s Veterans Home in the state budget.  There was not enough funding to open the facility, but with much support from the community funding was secured and the Home opened in October 2013. During his second term, Perea advocated for increased transportation funding for shovel ready projects, and as a result cities and counties received additional funding, along with funding for highway maintenance.

In December, Perea was named Chair of the Assembly Agriculture Committee.

Assembly Member,Rudy Salas Jr.,"Rudy Salas Jr. was born and raised in California?s Central Valley.  Growing up in a modest neighborhood, Salas noticed that his neighborhood didn?t have the same basic services and amenities as other areas.  He quickly learned that in order to improve his community, he had to work with local elected officials to get answers and fight for a fair share of the resources.  This sparked his passion for public service.

While working towards his goal of public service, Salas worked in both the oil and grape fields getting firsthand experience in the largest industries that fuel the economy of his district.

First elected to the Richmond City Council in 2005, Thurmond served as Council Liaison to Richmond?s Youth Commission, the Workforce Investment Board and the West Contra Costa Unified School District.

His priorities in the Assembly will be a continuation of his priorities as a non-profit leader, school board member, and as a city councilmember. Specifically, Thurmond plans to focus on improving the local and statewide economy, improving education from the ground up and preventing crime.

As a community advocate, Thurmond has helped create job training and workforce housing programs that can serve as a model for state efforts at poverty reduction.  Further, he recognizes that creating sustainable jobs for California youth is a successful way to reinvest in local communities.

Immediately prior to his election to the Assembly, Thurmond?s project, CEO Youth, was improving school attendance and reducing dropout rates?issues that he will continue to prioritize in the Assembly.  Recognizing that jobs, education and crime are interrelated challenges, Assemblymember Thurmond believes that,

?To get it right, we need to give our youth a California as good as its promise.  To get there, we need to do the real work to improve our schools, reduce dropout rates, create sustainable jobs that preserve our environment and invest in job training opportunities to build a 21st-century workforce.?

Assembly Member,Shirley Nash Weber,"Assembly Member Shirley Nash Weber was elected in November of 2012 to represent California's 79th Assembly District, which includes the cities of Chula Vista, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, National City and San Diego.

Weber Chairs the Assembly Committee on Budget, Assembly Select Committee on Higher Education in San Diego County; and the Assembly Select Committee on Campus Climate. She also serves on the Assembly committees on Education, Higher Education and Appropriations.

Born to sharecroppers from Hope, Arkansas, Shirley Weber has lived in California since the age of 3. Her parents, in particular her father, valued education and supported their daughter's academic aspirations. She attended UCLA, where she received her BA, MA and PhD by the age of 26. Prior to receiving her doctorate, she became a professor at San Diego State University at the age of 23. Dr. Weber also taught at California State University at Los Angeles and Los Angeles City College before coming to San Diego State University.

Weber has lived in the 79th Assembly District for over 30 years. Deeply committed to community service, she served on the boards of the NAACP, the YWCA, the YMCA Scholarship Committee, Battered Women Services, United Way and the San Diego Consortium. She eventually made a successful run for a seat on the board of the San Diego Unified School District. As a trustee and subsequent school board president, she became known for her advocacy for closing the achievement gap and setting a higher standard of excellence for all children.

As an Assemblymember, Weber has translated her commitment to education into her ambitious legislative agenda. During her freshmen year in the California State Legislature, five of seven of her successful bills were related to education, including ACR 45 urging lawmakers and the governor to restore funding to early childhood education; AB 56 requiring standards for installing carbon monoxide devices in schools, and AB 899 linking English language. Bills signed in 2014 include legislation addressing civil rights, education, protections for person with disabilities and voting rights.

Her Select Committee on Campus Climate has been exploring some of the racial incidents on state university campuses, the responses from university officials, and possible policy changes to make the campuses safer and more welcoming for all students. She is also outspoken on the importance of investing in early childhood education as a means of preventing drop-out rates, dependence on social services, incarceration and unemployment.

Assembly Member Weber is the mother of a daughter and son, and has two grandchildren. She is the widow of the late Honorable Daniel Weber, a California state judge."
Assembly Member,Scott Wilk,"Scott Wilk was elected to the California State Assembly in 2012 and was re-elected in 2014. He represents the 38th Assembly District which encompasses Simi Valley, the northwestern section of the San Fernando Valley, and most of the Santa Clarita Valley including the city of Santa Clarita and the communities of Agua Dulce, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, and Val Verde.
 
During his first term in office, Scott quickly established himself as a results-oriented leader and was appointed as Republican Caucus Chair for the Assembly Republican Caucus Leadership Team. The Caucus Chair is the number-two position in the Republican leadership structure and Caucus Chair assists the Leader in overseeing caucus operations, advancing the Republican policy agenda, and achieving the Caucus? legislative goals.  
 
For the 2015-16 Legislative Session, Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins named Scott as Vice Chairman of the new Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection. This brand new committee will have jurisdiction over all aspects of privacy from Internet media to consumer retail information to electronic medical records as well as other issues in the broader field of technology: the security of data, protection of personal information, information technology generally, and even California?s own Department of Technology. The committee will also be responsible for legislation related to false advertising, product labeling and consumer protection generally.
 
Additional committees Wilk has been assigned to include: Budget Committee (Sub 4 - State Administration), the Governmental Organization Committee, the Business and Professions Committee and the Joint Committee on Arts.
 
Keeping jobs in California is a high priority for Wilk and he played an important role in the passage of Assembly Bill 1839, the California Film and Television Job Retention and Promotion Act. California?s film tax credit will be increased to $330 million a year for five years beginning with fiscal year 2015-16 and replaces the current lottery system with a more competitive and accountable system.
 
To ensure greater accountability from non-elected bureaucrats, Wilk authored AB 1707 which will require the State Water Resources Control Board to post scientific peer reviews on its website as it relates to communities having to comply with TMDL standards. The law goes into effect on January, 1 2015.
 
Scott has been a vocal advocate for government transparency in the election process, which is why he authored AB 2551 to establish a minimum standard of transparency for the fiscal analysis of local bond measures that is very similar to what the LAO already does for state General Obligation bond measures.
 
In 2014, Scott was selected by the non-partisan, non-profit State Legislative Leaders Foundation to attend the prestigious Emerging Leaders Program held at the University of Virginia. The program is geared toward newer legislators that show promise as future legislative leaders, Scott was the only legislator selected from California. 
 
Scott and his wife Vanessa reside in Santa Clarita and they have two adult children."
Assembly Member,Das Williams,"Assemblymember Das Williams was elected to the Assembly in November 2010 and represents over half of the County of Santa Barbara, as well as nearly a quarter of the County of Ventura.

Williams previously served as a member of the Santa Barbara City Council, a position to which he was elected in 2003, and sat on a local school board for Peabody Charter School. Williams led the successful efforts to expand alternative energy produced by the city to ensure that 34% of the city's energy came from renewable sources by 2012. He also increased frequency of transit to every 10-15 minutes during peak periods.

As current Chair of the Natural Resources Committee in the State Assembly, Williams fights to reduce climate change, further sustainability efforts, and protect precious resources. To protect underground sources of drinking water from oil and gas wastewater disposal and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) treatments, he authored a bill that would require groundwater monitoring near Class II injection wells. This would provide the State Water Resources Control Board the authority to review groundwater monitoring plans as part of oil companies' permit application or notice of intent for injection wells.

One of Williams? first actions in the California State Assembly was to support Governor Brown?s effort to increase California?s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 33% renewable energy by 2020. With this initial goal well on track, Williams has authored legislation to further boost the RPS to 50% by 2030.

In 2014, Williams eliminated the exemption in the law that allows local government to count green waste used as daily cover, as ?diverted.? This practice misleadingly treats landfill disposals as ?recycling,? undermining efforts to promote beneficial uses of organic waste, and significantly contributing to global warming by producing powerful methane emissions.

As the former Chair of the Higher Education Committee, Williams has played an integral role in higher education policy. He has supported Governor Brown?s successful efforts to balance the state?s budget, and increase funding to our local schools.  This is an extension of the work he did locally to balance the budgets of the city and school during tough fiscal times without eliminating positions in vital services like police, fire, and teachers. As Chair of the Committee, he co-authored a bill to restore $100 million in funds to the UCs and CSUs. Despite the bill being vetoed by the Governor, Williams remains committed to lowering the cost of Higher Education and increasing access for all California students.  

In addition to bettering the Higher Education experience through affordability and accessibility, Williams is also committed to ensuring that students feel safe and supported on campus.  In response to reports on campus sexual assault, he held three statewide campus hearings at UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Los Angeles. From those discussions, he has proposed a Campus Sexual Assault Legislative Package which includes changes to the college campus adjudication process, sets a minimum sentencing requirement, and mandates campus reporting for students found guilty of assault.

In response to the 2014 Isla Vista tragedy, Williams co-authored AB 1014, establishing a process for obtaining a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) from a court in order to temporarily limit an individual?s access to firearms when there are warning signs or indications that the person is at risk for violence to him/herself and others.

In 2014, Williams was elected as the Chair of the Asian & Pacific Islander (API) Legislative Caucus, becoming the first Indonesian American to serve in this role. Recently, the API Legislative Caucus has focused its efforts on strengthening programs serving immigrant communities, increasing accessibility to healthcare, and improving the state of education in California.  

Growing up in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, Williams has been an active participant in numerous community endeavors throughout his life. He served for years as a community organizer for CAUSE, a Ventura based non-profit, and headed the group's efforts to stop a proposed big-box retail development in Ventura. Until his election, Williams served as a national board member of the National Organization for Women (NOW), and taught at Antioch University in Santa Barbara. Prior to his public service, Mr. Williams worked as a junior high school teacher, as well as a legislative aide to California State Assemblymember Hannah Beth Jackson.

Williams holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science & Management, with a focus on water pollution, planning processes, and land-use law at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science."
Assembly Member,Jim Wood,"Jim Wood was elected in November 2014 to represent California?s 2nd Assembly District, which comprises all of Del Norte, Trinity, Humboldt and Mendocino counties, plus northern and coastal Sonoma County, including the northern half of Santa Rosa.

Wood has lived in Northern California since 1987, when he opened his family dental practice in Cloverdale. He was elected to the Healdsburg City Council in 2006 and has served two terms as Mayor. Wood has worked to make local government more effective through reorganizing city departments to increase efficiency, balancing the budget, and streamlining the building permit process. His priorities are economic development, environmental protection, health care and fiscal reform.

Under Wood?s direction, Healdsburg has maintained a solid bottom line and leads the region in environmental policies. Wood co-founded the Healdsburg Green City Committee to implement green building principles, such as encouraging solar installations, increasing water conservation standards, and expanding energy efficiency rebate programs. The city has the highest renewable power of any city in Sonoma County.

In addition to his work in local government, Wood is a forensic dentistry expert who has been sent to national disaster sites to help identify victims and consults with five Northern California counties. He co-founded a mass disaster identification team in California and helped pass state legislation to standardize county identification procedures, a model now adopted by other states. He has received commendations for this work.

Wood lives in Sonoma County with his wife and son."
