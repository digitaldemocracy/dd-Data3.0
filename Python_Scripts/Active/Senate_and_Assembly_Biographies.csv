Senator,Joel Anderson,"After four years of service in the State Assembly, Senator Joel Anderson was elected in 2010 to represent the citizens of San Diego and Riverside Counties in the thirty-sixth Senate district.  In 2014, he was re-elected to office, representing the thirty-eighth Senate district.

When first elected to the Assembly, he promised his constituents, ""I am not going to Sacramento to be a potted plant.""

True to his word, Senator Anderson authored a landmark piece of legislation in his first year of service in the Assembly.  

Assembly Bill 221 required the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System to divest from companies that violated federal law by doing business in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This legislation called for the divestment of over $24 billion of our public pensions from the Islamic Republic of Iran - the top exporter of terrorism throughout the world.

The bill sparked a national movement which led 28 other states and the United States Congress to introduce similar laws. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced to the world that he would sign AB 221 on the floor of the United Nations during his speech to the General Assembly.

AB 221 garnered national and international media coverage in over 300 articles in 13 countries. Media coverage included Time Magazine, New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Fox News' ""Your World with Neil Cavuto,"" BBC, Bloomberg, The National Review, Le Monde (France), and The Jerusalem Post (Israel).

To keep our roads safe, Senator Anderson authored legislation to make the Regional Transportation Management Center a 24/7 operation.

In recognition of the sacrifice that the men and women of our military have made in the protection of our freedoms, Senator Anderson passed AB 257 into law, which granted free state park passes to disabled veterans and recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Senator Anderson was also recognized with the 2007 ""San Diego Psychiatric Society Legislative Award"" for his ""interest in, sensitivity to, and knowledge of mental health issues."" 

Senator Anderson<'-TOKEN>s success in 2007 led national talk radio host, Roger Hedgecock, to call Joel, ""the greatest freshman Assemblyman from San Diego ever.""

In 2008, Senator Anderson joined forces with the state's sheriffs and district attorneys to curb the rampant crime of metal theft. For his dedication, these groups named Senator Anderson their Legislator of the Year.

Senator Anderson<'-TOKEN>s reach was felt on a wide array of issues; several other organizations recognized Joel for his key role as a watchdog on their cause. For his efforts to protect the Second Amendment, Senator Anderson was named the ""2008 California Rifle & Pistol Association Legislator of the Year."" He also fought hard to keep public land open for public use during his first term which earned him the ""2008 California League of Off-Road Voters Legislator of the Year Award.""

As one of their most successful alums in recent memory, Senator Anderson was awarded the ""2008 Young Republican Federation of California's Legislator of the Year Award"" for his tremendous record of success during his first term in the Legislature.

In 2009, Senator Anderson focused on fixing the state's economy and bringing jobs back to our great state. Many California businesses began leaving as the state began issuing IOUs. Joel responded by authoring AB 1506, which protects taxpayers from the state's ""forced-borrowing"" by requiring the state to accept its own IOUs for payment of state taxes and fees.

AB 1506 had 74 bi-partisan co-authors and received over 3,000 letters of support from taxpayers, labor unions, small businesses, elected officials including State Controller John Chiang.

Senator Anderson<'-TOKEN>s efforts to protect small businesses and taxpayers earned him the ""2009 Lakeside Chamber of Commerce Legislator of the Year Award"" and the ""2009 Pacific Water Quality Association's Legislator of the Year Award.""

In recognition of his efforts on behalf of veterans and their families, in 2010 the California Branch of the American Legion, named Senator Anderson as their <""-TOKEN>Legislator of the Year.<""-TOKEN>

After being sworn in as the State Senator from California<'-TOKEN>s thirty-sixth Senate District, representing over 1,000,000 constituents, Senator Anderson affirmed his commitment to fight every day on behalf of those he represents. In 2011, for his efforts to protect small businesses during the great recession, Senator Anderson was named the <""-TOKEN>California State Senate Legislator of the Year<""-TOKEN> by the California Small Business Association and California Small Business Roundtable.

In 2012, as Vice-Chair of the Senate Public Safety Committee, Senator Anderson continued his work to protect crime victims by authoring Senate Bill 1371, which passed both the Senate and Assembly unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Brown.  SB 1371 closed a loophole in current law that allowed convicted criminals to get out of paying restitution to the victims of their crimes.

In 2014, Senator Anderson authored SJR 17, which urged President Barack Obama<'-TOKEN>s administration to expedite visa processing for Iraq<'-TOKEN>s minority groups and to lift the refugee quota cap for Iraqi-Christians in order to streamline the process of accepting them into the United States as refugees as they are under persecution from the Sunni Islamist terrorist group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

That same year he also worked with Senator Ted Lieu (D-Los Angeles) to pass SB 828, a bill which prohibits the state from providing material support, participation or assistance to the federal government to collect electronically stored information or metadata if the if the state has actual knowledge that the request constitutes an illegal or unconstitutional collection of electronically stored information or metadata.

In 2014, Senator Anderson was re-elected to the California State Senate, representing Senate district thirty-eight.

Senator Anderson is a member of  the Senate Health Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments.  He is also a member of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee.

While Senator Anderson<'-TOKEN>s accomplishments are many, the most important role in Joel's life is that of being a husband to his wife Kate for 25 years, and a father to their three children - Mary, Maura and Michael."
Senator,Patricia C. Bates,"My name is Patricia C. Bates, but I am better known as <""-TOKEN>Pat.<""-TOKEN> I am honored to serve as the Senator for the 36th Senate District in the California Legislature since December 1, 2014, representing nearly 1 million people from Encinitas in San Diego County to Rancho Santa Margarita in Orange County.

Elected public service was not something I sought growing up. It came gradually when I became a wife, mother, and community volunteer. My professional background is one of a Los Angeles County social worker, a position in which I helped people deal with some tough challenges in their personal lives.

What I learned as a social worker was that government must not rob people of their self-esteem and initiative. Government has an important role in protecting public safety and health, but it must act within the limits placed upon it by the people. After all, government exists to serve the people, not the other way around.

In the Senate, my focus is to solve everyday problems for Californians in a way that will preserve our quality of life, protect taxpayers, and restore fiscal common sense to government. That is what I did as the driving force behind Laguna Niguel<'-TOKEN>s campaign for cityhood and when I became its first mayor upon the city<'-TOKEN>s incorporation in 1989. I served four terms as mayor and then continued serving as a city council member until my election to the State Assembly in 1998, earning the trust of a large majority of Orange and San Diego County voters.

When I was in the Assembly, I served as Vice Chair of the Assembly Appropriations and Assembly Health committees, and was the founding Chair of the Republican Women<'-TOKEN>s Caucus to ensure that women from across the political spectrum were fully represented. While serving in the Assembly, I was appointed to the prestigious Little Hoover Commission, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed me to serve on his historic California Performance Review Commission <--TOKEN> responsible for providing recommendations on reforming state government and its operations.

On January 9, 2007, I was sworn-in as an Orange County Supervisor by former California Education Secretary and Senator Marian Bergeson. As only the fourth woman ever elected to the Board of Supervisors, I worked diligently to protect taxpayers and improve the county<'-TOKEN>s fiscal outlook; create business friendly policies to attract jobs; maintain high levels of public safety; shorten the timeline for delivery of transportation projects; implement pension and retiree medical liability reforms; and protect our coastal environment.

I am a proud native of Southern California, growing up in Long Beach and moving to South Orange County four decades ago. My husband John is an accomplished architect, and I am proud to have two adult children and four grandchildren."
Senator,Jim Beall,"Jim Beall brings a lifetime of experience and understanding in government efficiency, transportation, and human services to the State Senate.

In three decades of public service <--TOKEN> first as a San Jose City Councilman, then as a Santa Clara County Supervisor, and an Assembly member -- Jim Beall has left his mark across Silicon Valley.

He spurred the construction of Highways 85 and 87; fought to bring BART to San Jose; and authored bills to ease financing for seismic upgrades for our hospitals and also to grow California<'-TOKEN>s solar industry. This has meant thousands of good jobs for working families.

He is known throughout California for his legislation to help foster care children, low-income families, and people with disabilities.

And he has made a lasting difference in the lives of over 100,000 local youngsters by leading the drive to create the Children<'-TOKEN>s Health Initiative to ensure that every child in Santa Clara County can be covered by health insurance.

Beall plans to continue to help the people of Silicon Valley for years to come."

This region makes some of the nation<'-TOKEN>s best wine, grows most of its food, and produces the milk and cheese millions of people enjoy. Small business is the backbone of the area. Agriculture, wine making, tourism, and manufacturing--just a few of the region<'-TOKEN>s industries--contribute billions of dollars to the state<'-TOKEN>s economy.

Tom is a fourth-generation California farmer who has been active in many community groups, business organizations, and efforts to improve the quality of life in his community.

Elected to the Senate in 2010 and reelected in 2014, Tom serves on the Agriculture; Business, Professions and Economic Development; Governmental Organization; Human Services; and Insurance Committees.  He is Vice-Chairman of both Governmental Organization and Human Services. As former Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Vice Chair of the Rural Caucus, ensuring rural California has a voice in Sacramento remains his top priority. He continues to fight for a repeal of the fire tax, to protect both the Williamson Act, and rural public safety funding, as well as reforms that safeguard taxpayer dollars. In the Assembly, Tom was a member of the water bond working group. He continues his work on this issue in the Senate. Some of Tom<'-TOKEN>s legislative highlights include:

Senator,Kevin de Leon,"The first Latino elected President pro Tempore of the California State Senate in more than 130 years, Senator Kevin de Le<O-TOKEN>n (D-Los Angeles) is setting a bold agenda to give every kid a fair shot at a higher education, and to combat climate change while building a new, low-carbon economy with opportunities for all Californians. Leading the Senate of the largest state in the union, Senator de Le<O-TOKEN>n takes on challenging issues that strengthen the national reach of California<'-TOKEN>s policy-making. As co-chair of Proposition 39 <--TOKEN> the California Clean Energy Jobs Act <--TOKEN> Senator de Le<O-TOKEN>n convinced voters to close a corporate tax loophole to generate billions of dollars and fund more than 40,000 California jobs that improve energy efficiency and expand clean energy generation in schools. This year, Senator de Le<O-TOKEN>n<'-TOKEN>s Democratic caucus has introduced legislation to strengthen California<'-TOKEN>s climate leadership by pursuing standards that will reduce petroleum use by 50 percent, set a 50 percent renewable energy standard for the state<'-TOKEN>s utilities and increase building energy efficiency by 50 percent, all by 2030.

In 2012, Senator de Le<O-TOKEN>n authored Senate Bill 1234 <""-TOKEN>Secure Choice Act<""-TOKEN> which created a first-in-the-nation retirement savings program for over 6.3 million workers in California<'-TOKEN>s private sector. The New York Times called his efforts to provide retirement security to millions of low-income workers <""-TOKEN>a model for addressing a national problem.<""-TOKEN> Other legislative accomplishments include trailblazing authorship of the 'Yes Means Yes' bill to protect college students against violence and sexual abuse; Assembly Bill 31 which allocated local park assistance funds to communities lacking parks and green space, resulting in 126 park projects across the state; Workers<'-TOKEN> Compensation reform that lowered insurance costs for businesses, while increasing workers<'-TOKEN> benefits; and lead negotiator for the expansion of California<'-TOKEN>s Film and Television Tax Credit to keep Hollywood<'-TOKEN>s production jobs at home in the Golden State. Long before being arriving at the Legislature, de Le<O-TOKEN>n dedicated himself to public service and served immigrant communities through teaching U.S. citizenship courses. The work led him to community organizing and taking a stand against 1994<'-TOKEN>s Proposition 187, a voter-approved statewide initiative that denied government services to undocumented immigrants. In response, Senator de Le<O-TOKEN>n organized the largest civil rights march in California history. Twenty years later, Senator de Le<O-TOKEN>n continues to fight for immigrants<'-TOKEN> rights. He authored Senate Bill 396 erased the language of Prop 187 from California law in addition to first-in-the-nation legislation to prevent the unnecessary separation of families, protecting them from legal complications due to differences in immigration status. In 2013, he brokered a compromise with Governor Jerry Brown to ensure signage of Assembly Bill 60, a law which allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses so they could drive to work, maintain insurance and step out of the shadow economy. De Leon credits his immigrant mother for teaching him the nobility of a hard day<'-TOKEN>s work and our shared obligation to build a brighter future for the next generation. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, later earning a degree with Honors from Pitzer College. He is a Rodel Fellow at the Aspen Institute and a guest lecturer at the University of Southern California.

She also was the first woman elected mayor of the City of Berkeley (1986-1994), the Executive Director of the Shalan Foundation, and served in both the Carter and Clinton Administrations.

Senator Hancock currently represents the 9th State Senate District, which includes the cities of Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Emeryville, El Sobrante, Hercules, Kensington, Oakland, Piedmont, Pinole, Richmond, Rodeo, San Leandro and San Pablo.

Criminal Justice

Senator Hancock has been a leading advocate for  investing state resources in rehabilitation programs, job training, and employment because she understands that these and similar programs reduce inmate recidivism. As Chair of the Senate Public Safety Committee and the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Subcommittee #5 on Corrections and Public Safety, Senator Hancock seeks to examine programs at all levels of the criminal justice system and implement sound policies that reduce prison overcrowding while protecting public safety.

Senator Hancock believes that California<'-TOKEN>s corrections system is an expensive failure and requires a fundamental restructuring. As a start, Senator Hancock is working to bring government closer to the people by allowing local governments to carry out vital law enforcement services in a more effective and efficient manner.

Senator Hancock has introduced legislation to provide case management and evidence-based programming to inmates in their last year of incarceration, and bring transparency and accountability to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the Office of the Inspector General. Previously, she has introduced legislation to improve education programs in state prison and require the CDCR to provide inmates with a CA identification card upon release of incarceration.

Government Reform

Since entering the California State Legislature, Senator Hancock has vigorously championed government reform.  In 2009-10, she chaired the Elections, Reapportionment and Constitutional Amendments Committee. She introduced two major Senate Constitutional Amendments aimed at reducing gridlock and increasing the effectiveness of the California State Legislature: SCA 5 would have replaced the 2/3 vote formerly required to pass a budget with a simple majority vote and SCA 24 would change California<'-TOKEN>s term limits requirement so experienced legislators are available to solve the difficult problems facing California.

As an Assemblymember, Senator Hancock authored AB 583 <--TOKEN> the California Clean Money and Fair Elections Act <--TOKEN> which sought to reform campaign financing by providing full public financing for statewide elections.  AB 583 establishes a pilot project to make public financing available to candidates for Secretary of State so they can wage competitive campaigns without soliciting money from special interests.

Environment

Senator Hancock has sustained a strong commitment to environmental protection throughout her career.  As a member of the Berkeley City Council, she successfully worked to preserve the Berkeley Marina from development and protect local wildlife.

While in the Assembly, Senator Hancock served as Chair of the Committee on Natural Resources.   In this role, she led efforts to pass historic environmental legislation that would protect open space, expand recycling, and promote healthy city-infill strategies.

Senator Hancock currently serves on the Environmental Quality Committee, which oversees legislation relating to air and water quality, waste management and toxic substances, among other environmental issues.

Education

As head of the Western Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Education during the Clinton Administration, Hancock launched after-school, early reading preparation, college preparedness, and other initiatives. She helped schools in California receive millions of dollars in federal education funding.

As a member of the Assembly and Senate Committees on Education, Senator Hancock fought against tuition increases, elimination of outreach programs, and deep cuts to community college, CSU and UC budgets.

Senator Hancock has authored legislation that greatly expands school-to-career education for California<'-TOKEN>s high school students.  She strongly believes in career academies because they keep young people in school, and better prepares them for college and for real jobs in the new economy.  Senator Hancock currently chairs the Select Committee on Workforce Development, School Environment, and Student Wellness.

Senator,"Dr. Ed Hernandez, O.D.","Dr. Ed Hernandez had only one goal as a young man <--TOKEN> to serve the health care needs of the community he came from.  As an optometrist and local businessman, he never dreamed he would one day work in the California State Legislature.  As a health care provider in predominantly low-income communities though, the need to improve access to health care is what drove him to run for office.  Dr. Ed was first elected to the Assembly in November of 2006, and re-elected in November of 2008.  He won his seat in the California State Senate in November of 2010 and was re-elected once again in 2014.

Senator Hernandez serves as Chair for the Senate Committee on Health.  He is also a member of the Business, Professions, and Economic Development Committee, the Government and Finance Committee,  the Committee for Governmental Organization, and the Senate Insurance Committee.

Senator Hernandez is the Chair of the San Gabriel Valley Legislative Caucus, made up of 12 Senators and Assemblymembers representing the greater San Gabriel Valley.  This position has allowed him to work in cooperation with fellow legislators on issues critical to the San Gabriel Valley, including water and transportation.

Senator Hernandez grew up in La Puente, attended local schools and graduated from Bassett High School.  He worked his way through school, attending both Rio Hondo and Mt.

Senator,Bob Hertzberg,"Hi. I<'-TOKEN>m Bob Hertzberg. It is my honor and privilege to serve the nearly 1 million residents of the San Fernando Valley in the California Senate, for which I was elected in November, 2014.

As many of you know, this is not my first stint as a statewide policy maker. I was first elected to the California Assembly in 1996. After three years of hard work, I was twice unanimously elected Speaker and served until 2002. Then I spent a dozen years building a successful career in private industry and helping to establish groundbreaking public policy in several areas. I<'-TOKEN>ve always fought for BIG and BOLD ideas to fix California and tried to always think long term and solve tough problems.

As Speaker, for example, I helped preserve the quality of our air and water. I fought to stop the abuse of the elderly and to protect consumers from credit card companies and big banks. I supported expansion of the Cal-Grants program, giving more poor students unprecedented access to California<'-TOKEN>s colleges and universities. And I responded to public safety concerns by leading the way on opening new criminal investigation laboratories. By focusing on the future, such as our education infrastructure, our next generation of leaders can only be better prepared to make public policy.

Among other accomplishments, on a range of issues challenging California:

Helped negotiate more than $35 billion in school construction bonds <--TOKEN> the largest municipal bond issue in U.S. history.
Hammered out a settlement on prudent water policies that advanced landmark agriculture-to-urban water transfers and provided a framework to end nearly seven decades of California/Colorado River water disputes.
Fought for establishment of a 10th UC campus in Merced to educate under-served students in an underserved region.
Also, while in the Assembly, and in response to term limits, I led development of a comprehensive program to train newly elected members. Called the Capitol Institute, the education program taught newly elected members how the Capitol works and the mechanics of how ideas became laws. Training sessions by veteran legislators and staff, videos and a set of binders became resources for new and old members alike. The Capitol Institute eventually expanded into a staff training program still offered today

Staying active

After leaving government service in 2002, I continued to be active, as a global clean-energy entrepreneur, as a lawyer and as a leader on government reform. Even though I left public office, I never stopped devoting time and energy toward solving California<'-TOKEN>s toughest problems.

The result <--TOKEN> today I am better qualified to serve California and am more knowledgeable of our problems than before. Working outside government for more than a decade provided invaluable insights into how our great state can better compete globally. I better understand the nuances of creating economic change.

Many of these insights came from working around the globe <--TOKEN> traveling throughout China and to numerous countries in Africa. In recognition of these efforts, I received the World Bank Award for Lighting Africa for a project in Rwanda. Also, UK Guardian, Europe<'-TOKEN>s leading newspaper, named me one of the <""-TOKEN>50 people who could save the planet.<""-TOKEN>

I broadened my business background when I co-founded Solar Integrated Technologies, the first solar company in Los Angeles. I then co-founded Renewable Capital <--TOKEN> a first-of-its-kind green venture capital company. Through Renewable Capital, I co-founded G24 Innovations, a company that produced lightweight and inexpensive solar panels.

Background

As a native of Los Angeles, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Redlands with bachelor<'-TOKEN>s degrees in History and English. Three years later, I received my Juris Doctor from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and have been an active member of the State Bar since 1979. I have two grown sons. David is a classical music composer and a Juilliard Graduate, and Daniel graduated Goucher College and, like me (poor guy), loves politics and public policy."

Cesar Chavez led the fight to gain workers<'-TOKEN> rights for thousands of farm laborers the Central Valley, and had a major impact in a generation of social movements.  From an auspicious beginning, Alejo developed a sense of personal commitment to helping his community.  In 2013, as California State Assemblymember for the 30th District, Alejo proved his commitment by authoring landmark legislation on behalf of the disadvantaged and underrepresented throughout California.

Like many Americans, Alejo found early opportunities through education.  After watching his parents use education as a stepping stone to a better life, Alejo understood the value of academic success.  Alejo<'-TOKEN>s father, a Vietnam War era veteran, used the G.I. bill to pursue vocational training and later his teaching credential at San Jose State; his mother becoming a nurse once finishing school.  After attending Watsonville High School and Gavilan Community College, Alejo transferred to the University of California at Berkeley.

At UC Berkeley, one of the nation<'-TOKEN>s top universities, Alejo graduated with honors, receiving dual bachelor<'-TOKEN>s degrees in political science and Chicano studies.  After returning home to teach special need students and at-risk youth, Alejo continued his education at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctorate (JD).

Assembly Bill (AB) 60 <--TOKEN> The Safe and Responsible Driver Act <--TOKEN> gives undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply for a driver<'-TOKEN>s licenses.  Once implemented, AB 60 will improve public safety by ensuring all drivers can be licensed and insured.  Equally as important, AB 60 gives millions of Californians the peace of mind to make the necessary travels in order to work and support their families without fear of unnecessary consequences.  In addition, Alejo managed to get AB 10 signed into law, raising the minimum wage in California to $10 an hour, the highest in the nation.  Income inequality has always been a pressing issue for Alejo, whose first bill as an Assemblymember proposed raising the minimum wage.  AB 10 was the culmination of three years<'-TOKEN> work and helps ensure equality and respect for our state<'-TOKEN>s minimum wage workers. 

Alejo previously made national headlines in May 2012 when he became the first Assemblymember to propose in the Assembly Chambers during legislative session. He and his wife, Karina Cervantez Alejo, married on December 8, 2012. Karina, who was previously elected as a Councilmember, now serves as the Mayor for the City of Watsonville.

Assembly Member,Frank Bigelow,"The first thing you<'-TOKEN>ll notice about rancher Frank Bigelow is his hat.

Assembly Member,Susan A. Bonilla,"Assemblywoman Susan A.

She is chair of the Assembly Business, Professions, and Consumer Protection Committee, and sits on the Assembly Health Committee and the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee. She also chairs the Assembly Select Committee on Increasing the Integration of STEM Education in California K-14 Schools.

In 2014, Assemblywoman Bonilla authored the groundbreaking business innovation and consumer protection bill, AB 2293, which clarifies insurance coverage for Transportation Network Companies such as Uber and Lyft. This bill ensures that drivers, passengers and pedestrians are protected, while supporting the innovative ride-sharing business model. During last year<'-TOKEN>s legislative session, she also authored two significant public safety measures: AB 1147, the Massage Therapy Reform Act, which returns local land-use authority to cities and counties to eliminate human trafficking and prostitution from the massage industry, and AB 2560, which addresses the recent number of child abuse cases in schools by ensuring all credentialed school employees understand their responsibilities to report all child abuse cases to local law enforcement. In addition, she co-authored AB 1432, which complements AB 2560 by requiring annual training on mandated reporting and identifying child abuse and neglect for all certified school employees.

This past year, Assemblywoman Bonilla made it a priority to address a number of public policy issues, including the state<'-TOKEN>s current physician shortage and discrimination against members of the LGBT community. AB 1838 allows more graduates of accelerated and fully accredited medical programs to become licensed physicians in California, and AB 2501 prohibits the use of the <""-TOKEN>panic defense,<""-TOKEN> where defendants claim that a state of panic provoked their malicious act, in an attempt to lower or escape charges. Furthermore, as a leader for women<'-TOKEN>s rights, Assemblywoman Bonilla helped keep women in the Science, Technology, Education, and Math (STEM) fields. AB 2350 requires universities to adopt policies to implement Title IX and protect the rights of pregnant graduate students, by ensuring that they receive the appropriate and necessary accommodations to complete their programs.

Adding to her legislative accomplishments, Assemblywoman Bonilla<'-TOKEN>s devoted efforts to improve our education system produced an additional $26.7 million for the K-12 High Speed Network, to meet internet requirements necessary for the implementation of the Common Core State Standards.

Assembly Member,Rob Bonta,"Assemblymember Rob Bonta was elected to the California State Assembly's 18th District in 2012, where he represents the cities of Oakland, Alameda, and San Leandro as the first Filipino American state legislator in the history of California.

Rob<'-TOKEN>s passion for justice and equality was instilled in him at a very young age by his parents, who taught him to understand injustice and the importance of joining the struggle to empower vulnerable communities. His father was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, and stood with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Deep South <--TOKEN> marching for equality and justice in Selma. His mother was and continues to be a long-time leader in the Filipino social justice movement.

Growing up in a trailer just a few hundred yards from Csar Ch<A-TOKEN>vez<'-TOKEN>s home, Bonta watched closely as his parents organized Filipino and Mexican American farm workers, infusing his formative years with first-hand experience of one of the greatest peaceful social, racial, and economic justice movements of all time. This had a huge impact on Rob<'-TOKEN>s life choices and pursuits, inspiring his life<'-TOKEN>s commitment to helping people.

Rob believed legal training was one of the most powerful ways to effect positive and profound change in the lives of those who needed it most. He worked his way through college cleaning laundry rooms and, with the help of financial aid, was able to achieve his dream of attending some of the best universities in the world, obtaining his Juris Doctorate from Yale Law School after attending Yale College and Oxford University in England.  Earning honors in college, Rob was also a scholar athlete, captaining the Yale Soccer team. He also paved the way for the advancement of students of color as a mentor and volunteered in support of local children struggling with poverty.

His legal career included work as a Deputy City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco, where he represented the City and County and its employees, and as a private attorney, where he fought to protect Californians from exploitation and racial profiling.  Rob was undefeated at trial, never losing a jury verdict for his clients. Prior to being elected to the Alameda City Council, Rob served as the Chair of the City of Alameda<'-TOKEN>s Economic Development Commission, where he focused on business attraction and retention efforts, and as board president for the Social Service Human Relations Board, where he fought to protect safety net services for the most vulnerable members of the community. As Vice Mayor of the City of Alameda, Bonta strongly supported public safety, fostered economic development, and exercised fiscal responsibility. 

In the Assembly, Bonta continues to build upon this work, successfully passing  legislation to keep neighborhoods safe, provide a quality education to all of our children, build prosperous and healthy communities, foster economic opportunity, and protect our social service safety net. In 2014, Bonta passed 20 bills through the Legislature, 16 of which were signed into law by Governor Brown (2 of those were signed as part of the Budget Act).

Bonta<'-TOKEN>s work to improve the health of Californians began as an elected member of the Alameda Health Care District Board of Directors, where he championed access to quality health care for all <--TOKEN> a goal he further pursued his first two years in the Assembly as a member of the Health Committee. He has also authored and co-authored a number of bills to promote public health, including AB 174 to provide funding for school-based health centers, AB 514 and AB 1629 to increase access to services for victims of gun violence, AB 1271 to require school safety plans to include a mental health plan for students, AB 966 to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STDs in prisons, and SB 1005 to expand health care benefits to undocumented members of our community.  Appointed Chair of the Assembly Health Committee by Speaker Toni Atkins in December 2014, Bonta continues to build upon this strong track record of promoting a healthier California by authoring AB 72 with Speaker Atkins, to ensure California continues to provide the best possible health care services to its residents.

As Chair of the Select Committee on Gun Violence in the East Bay during his first two years in the Assembly, Bonta held hearings throughout the state to engage stakeholders and identify strategies to reduce gun violence in his own district and throughout California. The hearings inspired Bonta to introduce AB 1629 to expand the California Victims Compensation Program to include reimbursement for violence prevention and intervention services to help heal victims, families, and communities harmed by violent crime. The bill passed the Legislature with strong bipartisan support and was signed by the Governor.

As Chair of the Public Employees, Retirement, and Social Security Committee, Bonta convened a series of hearings to address the $74 billion CalSTRS funding shortfall, which resulted in AB 1469, a legislative fix to address the long-term CalSTRS shortfall and ensure that hard-working teachers receive the retirement security they have been promised.

Bonta paid tribute to his parents<'-TOKEN> work and the Filipino-American community by authoring AB 123 his first year in the Assembly. AB 123 requires state school curricula to include the contributions of Filipinos to the farm labor movement in California. Governor Brown fittingly signed the bill during Filipino Heritage Month. Now, a new generation of Californians will learn about the transformative struggle for justice of the farm labor movement and the great historical collaboration between Filipino Americans and Latinos, which is so much a part of Bonta<'-TOKEN>s own family history.

Bonta currently serves as Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, the Public Employees, Retirement, and Social Security Committee, and the Co-Chair of the Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in California. He is also a member of the following committees: Appropriations, Budget, Budget Subcommittee No. 1 on Health and Human Services, Joint Legislative Budget, and Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management."

Achievements from First Term in the State Assembly (2012-2014)

Modernizing and Investing in our Roads and Highways 

Daly led the successful passage of a bill that enables an innovative, cost-savings approach to freeway improvement projects statewide.  The Orange County Transportation Authority says this new law will save Orange County taxpayers approximately $100 million and speed up the project completion date by two to three years on the 405 freeway improvement project.  For this effort, Daly was honored as <""-TOKEN>Legislator of the Year<""-TOKEN> by the California Transportation Foundation and Mobility 21 (Southern California transportation group)

Reducing Bureaucratic Red-Tape

Daly championed an effort to reduce processing delays for business filings in the Secretary of State<'-TOKEN>s Office.  The Legislature found that basic paperwork for starting a business was taking 6-8 weeks to be processed. That<'-TOKEN>s unacceptable, especially when it only takes Texas and New York 5 days.  Under Daly<'-TOKEN>s leadership, the Legislature acted quickly and insisted on a reasonable five-day turn-around. The processing time is now down to five days.

Supporting our Veterans

Daly was a principal co-author of the bill signed by Governor Brown to create an Orange County Veterans Cemetery.

Daly also led the charge to direct an additional $6 million to help California service veterans speed the processing of claims through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."

Washington, Atwater Village, and Silver Lake.

Gomez was born and raised in Southern California and is the youngest of six children. His parents and four of his siblings immigrated to California from Mexico in the early 1970s. They brought with them a strong sense of family and a strong work ethic. To make ends meet, his mother and father often worked multiple jobs.

After graduating from high school, Jimmy found work where he could <--TOKEN> at a fast-food restaurant and a local superstore. But instead of working a 9am to 5pm schedule, he worked from 5pm to 9am the next day. After several months of working both jobs, and with the memory of his parents<'-TOKEN> struggle to make ends meet...something just clicked! He now clearly understood the need of a good job with benefits, and most importantly a quality education.

With this newfound clarity, Jimmy enrolled in community college and ultimately transferred to UCLA, where he graduated magna cum laude and received a BA in Political Science with a minor in urban planning. Ten years after graduating from high school, he earned a Master<'-TOKEN>s in Public Policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.  

Gomez recognizes that his story today, although not unique, is a lot harder to achieve and out of reach for far too many people because of the struggling economy and the state budget deficit. He believes this is unacceptable and our families deserve better.

To help rebuild California, Gomez will fight to increase access to quality education and good jobs by providing leadership based on working class values, pragmatic problem solving skills and a dedication to the empowerment of individuals and communities.

As a Director for the United Nurses Associations of California, Gomez empowered nurses to better advocate for their patients through the legislative process and community service. He helped pass legislation to facilitate graduation of community college nursing and allied health students, and established a partnership with a community non-profit to promote healthy living for inner-city children.

Gomez<'-TOKEN>s previous work experience includes the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the National League of Cities, the Democratic National Committee, the office of former L.A.

She represents the 12th Assembly District, which encompasses parts of San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties in California<'-TOKEN>s Central Valley.  She is the first mother of school-aged children to serve as Leader of a Republican or Democratic caucus in the California Legislature.

A decisive leader who can bring people together, Olsen was named Chief Republican Whip in her first term. She served as Vice Chair of both the Assembly Agriculture and Education committees, and has also served on the Insurance, Higher Education and Accountability and Administrative Review Committees. She was named Legislator of the Year in 2012 by the Regional Council of Rural Counties, in recognition of her hard work and legislative achievements on behalf of her constituents and rural residents throughout the State.

Olsen is a committed and respected leader with a reputation for reform, problem-solving, and hard work. She was selected by the State Legislative Leaders Foundation for its prestigious 2012 Emerging Leaders Program which brought together rising leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, from all over the United States to participate in conference at the University of Virginia.

Born, raised and now raising her own family in Modesto, Olsen has a passion for the communities, businesses, and people of California<'-TOKEN>s Central Valley communities. She previously served on the Modesto City Council from 2005 to 2009, where she stood up for fiscal responsibility, public safety, and economic development.

During her time in the State Assembly, she has successfully passed reforms to environmental, education, and veterans policies in order to protect and grow jobs and facilitate educational excellence.  She also has been a leader on introducing reforms to enhance government accountability and transparency, and has led by example as the first legislator to release her office budget to the public.

In support of working families and small businesses, Olsen has introduced and co-authored bills that would update California<'-TOKEN>s antiquated labor code to allow working parents and all employees more flexible scheduling options.

A vocal advocate for youth and education, Olsen has partnered with colleagues to get important education reform measures passed.

AB 151 allows counties the option of waiving building and inspection permit fees for ADA-type modifications to homes owned by veterans with service-related disabilities. Before the passage of this bill, counties were required to collect fees for home modifications, improvements and inspections <--TOKEN> a process that was at times drawn out and expensive.

After graduating Magna Cum Laude from Westmont College in 1996 with a Bachelor<'-TOKEN>s in Communications Studies, Olsen was selected to participate in the prestigious Senate Fellowship Program, where she developed a passion for public service.  While serving on the Modesto City Council, she also worked as the Assistant Vice President for Communications & Public Affairs at California State University, Stanislaus where she directed the University<'-TOKEN>s marketing and communications programs.

Jim and wife Sharon have lived in Fresno for most of their lives, raising three children, and now three grandchildren in the Central Valley.
 
He spent most of his professional career as a businessman and broadcast executive owning and operating radio stations in California and Idaho.
 
Serving two terms as the Mayor of Fresno from 1993-2001, he inherited the leadership of a city in free-fall with exploding crime levels and out of control auto thefts. After eight years of focused leadership, Jim left the City of Fresno with a $20 million general fund surplus, a AAA credit rating, over a billion dollars of new business approvals that created thousands of new jobs, and a reborn reputation for achievement that the National Civic League recognized when it designated Fresno an All-America City in 2000.

In 2013 Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 1028, which fast-tracks licenses for vocational nurses by removing government red-tape.

He also completed the Senior Executive in State and Local Government program at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.

Perea began his career in public service in November 2002 when he was elected to the Fresno City Council at the age of 25, becoming the youngest person ever elected to the position. He was re-elected to serve a second term in 2006, and served as the Council President in 2007.

While in local office, Perea served as President of the Latino Caucus-League of California Cities, co-founded the Latino Water Coalition, and served on the board of the California League of Cities. He also served on the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District Board and was appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the California Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission.

During his first term in the Legislature, Perea chaired the Assembly Committee on Revenue and Taxation. There, he worked to bring a balanced approach to California<'-TOKEN>s tax policy. One of his accomplishments as Chair was getting Assembly Bill (AB) 36 signed into law; AB 36 provides tax relief to parents who keep their adult children on their family health plan.

During his second term Perea chaired the Assembly Committee on Insurance. As Chair, Perea got AB 1309 signed into law; AB 1309 closed a loophole in California<'-TOKEN>s Workers' Compensation system.  Additionally, amidst crisis with the Employment Development Department<'-TOKEN>s Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, Perea held legislative hearings, worked with the administration, and authored legislation to ensure claimants had access to their benefits. These efforts led to changes in the UI program that dramatically improved service. 

Some of Perea's other legislative accomplishments are within the areas of health care, energy, air quality, alternative fuels, and clean drinking water. In 2013, Perea successfully authored AB 327, California's first comprehensive electric rate reform bill since the 2001 energy crisis. He also successfully authored AB 219, a bill that lowers the out-of-pocket costs for cancer patients utilizing oral chemo therapy.

In addition, Perea was one of the lead authors of the water bond, and fought to bring funding for water infrastructure and good paying jobs to the Central Valley. The Association of California Water Agencies and the Latino Water Coalition both honored Perea for his leadership in securing passage of the water bond.

During his first term, Perea fought to save Fresno<'-TOKEN>s Veterans Home in the state budget.  There was not enough funding to open the facility, but with much support from the community funding was secured and the Home opened in October 2013. During his second term, Perea advocated for increased transportation funding for shovel ready projects, and as a result cities and counties received additional funding, along with funding for highway maintenance.

In December, Perea was named Chair of the Assembly Agriculture Committee.

Assembly Member,Rudy Salas,"Rudy Salas Jr. was born and raised in California<'-TOKEN>s Central Valley.  Growing up in a modest neighborhood, Salas noticed that his neighborhood didn<'-TOKEN>t have the same basic services and amenities as other areas.

This brand new committee will have jurisdiction over all aspects of privacy from Internet media to consumer retail information to electronic medical records as well as other issues in the broader field of technology: the security of data, protection of personal information, information technology generally, and even California<'-TOKEN>s own Department of Technology. The committee will also be responsible for legislation related to false advertising, product labeling and consumer protection generally.
 
Additional committees Wilk has been assigned to include: Budget Committee (Sub 4 - State Administration), the Governmental Organization Committee, the Business and Professions Committee and the Joint Committee on Arts.
 
Keeping jobs in California is a high priority for Wilk and he played an important role in the passage of Assembly Bill 1839, the California Film and Television Job Retention and Promotion Act. California<'-TOKEN>s film tax credit will be increased to $330 million a year for five years beginning with fiscal year 2015-16 and replaces the current lottery system with a more competitive and accountable system.
 
To ensure greater accountability from non-elected bureaucrats, Wilk authored AB 1707 which will require the State Water Resources Control Board to post scientific peer reviews on its website as it relates to communities having to comply with TMDL standards. The law goes into effect on January, 1 2015.
 
Scott has been a vocal advocate for government transparency in the election process, which is why he authored AB 2551 to establish a minimum standard of transparency for the fiscal analysis of local bond measures that is very similar to what the LAO already does for state General Obligation bond measures.
 
In 2014, Scott was selected by the non-partisan, non-profit State Legislative Leaders Foundation to attend the prestigious Emerging Leaders Program held at the University of Virginia. The program is geared toward newer legislators that show promise as future legislative leaders, Scott was the only legislator selected from California. 
 
Scott and his wife Vanessa reside in Santa Clarita and they have two adult children."
Assembly Member,Das Williams,"Assemblymember Das Williams was elected to the Assembly in November 2010 and represents over half of the County of Santa Barbara, as well as nearly a quarter of the County of Ventura.

Williams previously served as a member of the Santa Barbara City Council, a position to which he was elected in 2003, and sat on a local school board for Peabody Charter School. Williams led the successful efforts to expand alternative energy produced by the city to ensure that 34% of the city's energy came from renewable sources by 2012. He also increased frequency of transit to every 10-15 minutes during peak periods.

As current Chair of the Natural Resources Committee in the State Assembly, Williams fights to reduce climate change, further sustainability efforts, and protect precious resources. To protect underground sources of drinking water from oil and gas wastewater disposal and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) treatments, he authored a bill that would require groundwater monitoring near Class II injection wells. This would provide the State Water Resources Control Board the authority to review groundwater monitoring plans as part of oil companies' permit application or notice of intent for injection wells.

One of Williams<'-TOKEN> first actions in the California State Assembly was to support Governor Brown<'-TOKEN>s effort to increase California<'-TOKEN>s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 33% renewable energy by 2020. With this initial goal well on track, Williams has authored legislation to further boost the RPS to 50% by 2030.

In 2014, Williams eliminated the exemption in the law that allows local government to count green waste used as daily cover, as <""-TOKEN>diverted.<""-TOKEN> This practice misleadingly treats landfill disposals as <""-TOKEN>recycling,<""-TOKEN> undermining efforts to promote beneficial uses of organic waste, and significantly contributing to global warming by producing powerful methane emissions.

As the former Chair of the Higher Education Committee, Williams has played an integral role in higher education policy. He has supported Governor Brown<'-TOKEN>s successful efforts to balance the state<'-TOKEN>s budget, and increase funding to our local schools.  This is an extension of the work he did locally to balance the budgets of the city and school during tough fiscal times without eliminating positions in vital services like police, fire, and teachers. As Chair of the Committee, he co-authored a bill to restore $100 million in funds to the UCs and CSUs. Despite the bill being vetoed by the Governor, Williams remains committed to lowering the cost of Higher Education and increasing access for all California students.  

In addition to bettering the Higher Education experience through affordability and accessibility, Williams is also committed to ensuring that students feel safe and supported on campus.  In response to reports on campus sexual assault, he held three statewide campus hearings at UC Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Los Angeles. From those discussions, he has proposed a Campus Sexual Assault Legislative Package which includes changes to the college campus adjudication process, sets a minimum sentencing requirement, and mandates campus reporting for students found guilty of assault.

In response to the 2014 Isla Vista tragedy, Williams co-authored AB 1014, establishing a process for obtaining a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) from a court in order to temporarily limit an individual<'-TOKEN>s access to firearms when there are warning signs or indications that the person is at risk for violence to him/herself and others.

In 2014, Williams was elected as the Chair of the Asian & Pacific Islander (API) Legislative Caucus, becoming the first Indonesian American to serve in this role. Recently, the API Legislative Caucus has focused its efforts on strengthening programs serving immigrant communities, increasing accessibility to healthcare, and improving the state of education in California.  

Growing up in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, Williams has been an active participant in numerous community endeavors throughout his life. He served for years as a community organizer for CAUSE, a Ventura based non-profit, and headed the group's efforts to stop a proposed big-box retail development in Ventura. Until his election, Williams served as a national board member of the National Organization for Women (NOW), and taught at Antioch University in Santa Barbara. Prior to his public service, Mr. Williams worked as a junior high school teacher, as well as a legislative aide to California State Assemblymember Hannah Beth Jackson.

Williams holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science & Management, with a focus on water pollution, planning processes, and land-use law at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science."
Assembly Member,Jim Wood,"Jim Wood was elected in November 2014 to represent California<'-TOKEN>s 2nd Assembly District, which comprises all of Del Norte, Trinity, Humboldt and Mendocino counties, plus northern and coastal Sonoma County, including the northern half of Santa Rosa.

Wood has lived in Northern California since 1987, when he opened his family dental practice in Cloverdale. He was elected to the Healdsburg City Council in 2006 and has served two terms as Mayor. Wood has worked to make local government more effective through reorganizing city departments to increase efficiency, balancing the budget, and streamlining the building permit process. His priorities are economic development, environmental protection, health care and fiscal reform.

Under Wood<'-TOKEN>s direction, Healdsburg has maintained a solid bottom line and leads the region in environmental policies. Wood co-founded the Healdsburg Green City Committee to implement green building principles, such as encouraging solar installations, increasing water conservation standards, and expanding energy efficiency rebate programs. The city has the highest renewable power of any city in Sonoma County.

In addition to his work in local government, Wood is a forensic dentistry expert who has been sent to national disaster sites to help identify victims and consults with five Northern California counties. He co-founded a mass disaster identification team in California and helped pass state legislation to standardize county identification procedures, a model now adopted by other states. He has received commendations for this work.

Wood lives in Sonoma County with his wife and son."
