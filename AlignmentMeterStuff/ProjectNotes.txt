Project Notes:

You need to import all your extra alignments from, after correcting your alignment scraping script


AlignmentsMeter.py:

    - Correct votes fetcher so that you are certain you are only looking at passing votes


    - Rewrite logic to use vote dates instead of hids, because these don't always appear in order

Group by: pid then count the distinct votes, return the scores
