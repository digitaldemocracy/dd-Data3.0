Project Notes:

You need to import all your extra alignments from, after correcting your alignment scraping script

Go over with Hans, whether the passing votes you selected actually are passing votes

current spot:


AlignmentMeter.py:

Why is it there is a larger number of aligned_votes than total_votes


Sometimes the same oid has different alignments in the same freakin' hid. Somebody will need to go through and correct
these. Also examine these specific cases more thoroughly

Currently generating all your data is an almagamation of crap between python, sql, and jupyter. Make sure
you condense this all to one python file
