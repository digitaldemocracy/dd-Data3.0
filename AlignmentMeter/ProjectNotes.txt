Project Notes:

Top Priority:

- Just run everything together


- You're missing alignments where hid is null, these should definitely exist

- Check on notes from Christine from meeting, I think there was one thing she wanted to know
    - It had to do with the ratio of data that comes from the analysis files

- Talk it over w/ Nick and Eric to get things scheduled

- You're still missing some support and opposition that aren't grabbed by the scraper. Just check these later, nbd

Note:
- You changed the date you grab in fetch org_alignments. This could screw you later
